I jumped out of bed running put my armor on and grabbed my guns. I made my way out onto the tower and saw Zavala standing like the pillar of strength he is staring off toward the traveler.  Zavala looked like a majestic Greek god in all of his muscle bound glory.As I ran out of the hanger and up to Zavala I slapped his ass open palmed. With a stern look in his eyes he shouted.""Guardian not here"" then he winked and stuck out his tongue at me. ""I need you to go to the moon""I turned away looking at the ground and unable to look at him and he walked up behind me and hugged me from the back I never felt so safe in his strong embrace. I could feel his lips tickling the bottom of my my ear ""please for me guardian""I tried to push him away almost in tears but his embrace was so strong. ""Please...""I shook my head ""no""""Come on guardian do it for daddy Zala""He knew that would melt my frozen heart. I turned around leaned in for a big strong rock hard throbbing man on man hug and the smell of his pungent man musk filled my nostrils. As I turned to go back to the hanger Zavala shouted ""GUARDIAN""I stopped and turned and he walked up to me and held out his hand I extended mine and he embraced cupping my hand between his soft hands pulling my hand up to his mouth extending my fingers putting them in his mouth and slowly pulling them in and out a few times moaning  ""just one more taste before you leave"" I could feel my knees shaking should I tell him ""Zavala I lov"" He quickly put his thicc man finger right across my lips I could tell I was blushing.""Not now Guardian"" as a single tear ran down his face. I leaned in and licked the tear off his face""I am kissing your tears away so you can be strong for the tower Zavala""""Gardian if you can be strong for me I can be strong for you"" he smirked ""Guardian we can't send you off into battle with your armor not properly attached""I felt his hand on my thigh armor making it's way toward my center. He grabbed the tip of my zipper and slowly pulled it up making constant eye contact. Then he gave me a quick pat.

Didn't know much about it before I started playing. At the point of writing this, I have completed the main storyline, passed the cauldron in the expansion area storyline (The Cut), and also completed probably 75%+ of the collectibles (though I can't see me finishing them off).Thoroughly enjoyed the main storyline, which details how the current 'world' came about.Things which I think could be improved:* Climbing routes are denoted with white/yellow markings (semi-puzzles in some cases, especially the expansion area), sometimes these weren't really visible. They should be highlighted with the focus, this would remove the annoyance when feeling stuck half way through a route (and then needing to fall off, to get a better view).* When walking past NPCs in populated areas, you will hear them say phrases. There seems to be about 5-10 phrases on loop, regardless of where you are. So after a while it just becomes annoying to hear the same things over and over.* Deathbringer is an awful machine to fight, it will often end up super high in the air directly above you. Where you can't aim anywhere close to vertically up, I'm not sure what the trick for killing it is supposed to be.* You can cheese many of the large machine fights, by taking advantage of the fact all machines (except mounts) are tied to a certain area. So you can often stand slightly outside of their area behind an obstacle and tackle them whilst taking minimal damage. This is a bit harder with some of the largest machines, which can destroy large parts of the environment, but still possible.* Controlling mounts always felt a bit janky so I generally preferred to travel on foot. Also, trying to pick up plants whilst on mount often ended up in being mistimed, and me jumping off the mount.* When dying/loading save, my equipped weapon/arrow would always return to hunting arrows, rather than hard point/whatever I was previously using. Tedious.* Blast wire seems a bit OP,  really easy to kill some of the machines with it (Frostclaws probably being the worst offender in this case)* The expansion area (The Cut) introduces some new mechanics (snow storms when you're outside making visiblity awful, more puzzle-esque climbing route, 'cursed machines'). In general, I think these could have all done with a bit more QA, they don't feel as smooth and player friendly as the main game's content.Don't let this criticism take away from the positive review though, the main storyline is thoroughly worth playing.  The post credits scene, suggests there might be a sequel following Syler, I'd like to see that.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1151640,"21 August, 2021",55.2,51.6
2071,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995994585/recommended/,United Kingdom,9,Recommended,0,0,"Fun game with a large group of friends (e.g. 6+), but the incentives need changing to improve public players. Has a few rough edges, but well worth the low price if you have people to play with.Currently many players joining public matches instantly leave games whereby they don't end up imposter. This can leave games balanced for 10 players, with as few as 5 players (2 imposter, 3 crew) straight after the game has started. At this point, only one crew needs to die for the imposters to have won. Rendering the game pointless. A solution to this could be giving players a 5-10 minute timeout from public games, if they leave a game before they have been killed/ejected (though this could also backfire with players afk in cafe at start).There are harder to solve problems with public games, whereby players will out themselves as the imposter. This somewhat renders them a problem now, as if they aren't playing a long con, you can be sure they are never the imposter. I'm less sure how to remedy this, other than not playing public games (or replacing find server with matchmaking and player rankings etc, but that adds a whole host of complexity).In terms of gameplay, there are a wide range of settings which can be modified in hosted games. These can vastly unbalance the gameplay when abused (e.g. harming crew, improving imposters).My primary complaint however, would be that when an imposter you can't click vents to enter them. You instead have to click the vent button. This regularly catches me out, making me slower to enter vents. Consistency of clicking things to do tasks across the board would be useful.Oh and the swipe card task can be annoying until you learn the appropriate swipe speed.

Several missions consist of nothing but a 10 minute cutscene which unlocks a different mission on the otherside of the map. The final mission of the main storyline, you probably spend longer in cutscenes than you do actually completing objectives.Otherwise, game has much the same usual just cause gameplay (essentially invulnerable, fly around with a grapple destroying things and killing enemies, the missions are very forgiving in this regard, if you do die you only restart the current checkpoint or less). However, instead of capturing individual bases, you now complete a mission which enables you to 'move troops' into a region. You're supposed to unlock spare troops by earning chaos points, but it appears to be broken, because i kept gaining troops by unlocking regions. Ended the game with 19 spare troops and all regions unlocked, about 5 levels below max chaos. They should have kept it simple like the previous games, destroy a base, it turns blue.The expansion pack content is pretty eh, the demon/alien one really doesn't fit the game (I also uncovered a bug, where if i entered the demon dome in a helicopter, completion of the objectives didn't move the mission on until i died which reset them. The underground car battles one just wasn't my thing (drive a car that has built on guns around a track and get a high enough score to proceed). The agency one is actually kind of fun, as it introduces some novel content (enemies with grapples, new weapons/vehicles).The game also has way too many collectible tasks to complete to earn all the unlocks, something like 150 speed challenges, 150 pass this vehicle through this ring, 150 wingsuit challenges (pass through 2-4 rings). Most are easy to complete with a couple of attempts, a few make no obvious sense. Then there are about 15 each, elite ring and vehicle challenges, most of which are ridiculous and require you trying to get a boat inland and other stupid things. At the time of writing the review, I think i've got about 50% of all the none elite tasks, and im way too fatigued to finish.

With an additional storyline providing missions which unlock extra areas of the map and a few car upgrades.These activities net you scrap and some form of points, which you can use to upgrade your vehicle/equipment and bonuses respectively, whilst also reducing 'threat' in the area which should mean less enemies are roaming (this is implied by the game, but not 1sure if it's as effective as suggested). Game has some minor issues:* I've had enemies despawn for no visible reason during combat.* 20 hours into the game, having cleared Jeet's whole territory and most of Gutgash. I've only needed to jump twice. They keybinding is left ctrl, but this is not introduced anywhere during the game, so by the time you reach the need 15 hours in you probably assume there is no jump. However it's been necessary to access one hot air balloon and one loot (in a train carriage in the eastern tunnels). I googled the prior and found a steam community thread discussing it.* Default volume settings, car engine sounds are way too loud for my taste relative to voices. I haven't attempted to change this in settings yet, I just adjust my physical volume knob for speakers regularly.* Until you do enough story to get the explosive car weapon, some activities  seem a little off limits.* Usual issue whereby I suck at combat when I'm swarmed by 15 enemies and can't keep them all on screen at once, 5+ of which have special abilities. There's probably some strategy for this that I'm missing.General verdict is that if you like open world games with templated tasks you will probably enjoy this, otherwise you won't.I bought it in a sale for 75% off and it seems well worth it given the time I've spent playing it thus far.

It currently freezes up fairly regularly during game-play for several seconds at a time and it also crashes out every few hours (it simply closes instantly, without showing an error or similar). If you do manage to play the game for ~4 hours straight without crashing, you might find that the FPS suddenly drops leaving the game unplayable until you close it and reopen (I'd guess this is caused by a memory leak).It seems very likely that these issues will however be worked out over time as the developers have committed to expanding the game with free dlc in the future.

A mix of survival (in the sense that you must eat, you must have a varied diet to avoid certain immunity effects, you must stop things like bleeding, or fix broken bones, must sleep, stay hydrated, things along these lines) alongside traditional roguelike elements. A semi-randomly generated map, akin to something like Tales of Maj'Eyal, (in that some locations are never in the same location and are generated in a different location; leading to each playthrough and subsequent generation of your own playthroughs map feel unique) as well as a grid-based movement system, a health/mana bar, many different weapons of many different types, unique clothing and armor, differing classes with backstories and genders that effect how you are perceived in the world around you (For example, I am currently playing as a female sorcerer who is a mercenary; this is considered very strange in the games world and guards and others react to my characters presence accordingly). Speaking of magic, there are multiple different types of magic available should you choose to upgrade your character along those lines (Geomancy, Pyromancy, Cryomancy, Chronomancy, Electromancy, Venomancy, etc) all with their own pluses and minuses to how you might best utilize their strengths, leading to interesting player combination choices like a melee fighter that uses electromancy to buff their damage while using dual maces, giving the player the added benefits. Alongside the former I just mentioned the game is also beautiful. The pixel work is top notch, the sound design is amazing, I remember feeling genuinely intimidated upon entering the area a very powerful foe lurked in simply because the music set the mood of the fight and area so perfectly.

The shotgun is great (some boomer shooters have a problem with meh shotgun, Zan got it right on this), the rifle even works great.  The alternate weapons feel good, and add crazy dimensions, like the time crystals or the elemental ring.If you want to play a very original shooter, this is a good shot, well worth the price whatever it sits at.  I didn't get it on sale, and it's great.  You may get stuck a few times, I just got bogged down on combat, but it's a great game.It only has one episode, with another in progress, so I'll update my review whenever that happens, but even right now, it's well worth what you pay for it.

It was a prime example of 2k's ignorance at a great IP and fishering away their team for a flop of a sequel that was borderlands 3. Gear box did amazing with this game dispite all its flaws at launch, the game slowly became more stable by the middle of its life, but the playerbase never seemed to returned. Only a fair share of people who loved it came back and it had a wonderful and small community making fan art and writing fiction. I got too know some of the roleplay community who wrote and exspanding on the adventures of Solus and the small dying last star. I fairly enjoyed this most out of the ""Hero-Shooter"" Genre that spawned out 4 years ago. Yet this game got overshadowed and unfairly compared to Blizzards Overwatch. Battleborn was the more unique and interesting of the two because of the characters and world building and the actual Campaign you played. We could have gotten more if Gearbox stuck to battleborns development. Sadly they had to make the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• 3rd entry in Borderlands and well thats how things fell apart.My freind Captain Chaos has a better explanation of the game-play perspective of Battleborn, I'm not good at leaning into a large writing of how it works but to sum it up. You have alot of characters with diffrent gimmicks and roles, they level up while you play the levels, like some MOBA's let you. You can choose between 2 choices per level in a augment tree and eventually unlock augments with leveling the character on your player profile. Every character is amazing in their own way. Except Kid Ultra.Anyways I love this game to bits and as a farewell I have written this reveiw/letter of goodbye thing. I'm sad to see it go.

Now lthe devs are ambitous, that can be a good thing or a VERY BAD thing im scared that with all the things the devs want to put into the game might not make it because they will buckle under the pressure.

I really wanted to like this game and i do kinda. But with the way things are now i can not justify giving a positve review.

I think the bar was set very high for this game, and even though it didn't quite reach it, the game is still great, definitely better than 2 and 3. This is of course my opinion, but I think the skill point system is excellent. I understand why it has caused some controversy in the community but I think it fits pretty well and still holds its excellent weapon and enemy balance. The legion system is truly one of a kind and epic even if its a little disappointing in how often it occurs. I know the story focus is something different when it comes to Serious Sam, but for their first attempt I think Croteam did a great job. The characters are okay, some better than others and they serve their purpose in the story well enough. There were plenty of lines of dialogue that gave me a genuine chuckle (like the Rodriguez joke Jones makes). The story can be a bit iffy in spots, and semi-predictable. In spite of this there were some twists and other beats that genuinely surprised me. I do, however, agree that the story is the weakest part of the game, but its still passable and is very Sammy. Let's be honest though, most of us aren't in it for the story. We're in it for the guns, enemies, and gameplay that we all know and love, and that is certainly present. I cannot wait for the community to get their hands on the modding tools when the workshop goes live.

At the start the game feels fun and the story actually seems to be interesting, however, the gameplay becomes repetitive pretty fast, specially in PVE. Well you might say, just play PVP lmao, let's say I did, there are classes that outshine others in every aspect, even if you do master the dodge mechanic or ""git gud"". Sorceress, for example, has very safe skills with high dmg and low cooldown, whereas most characters have high cooldowns on their abilities with the most dps. You could also, for instance, focus on PVE only, but you will notice why this is not as viable as you thought initally once you reach endgame, since most PVE content is locked behind a specific gear level, which you can only upgrade witch chaos dungeons. Why is this a problem, you ask, you can only get gear 2 times a day through chaos dungeons. This doesn't mean you can't keep doing them, however, the progress will be MUCH MUCH slower, since you get certain materials that can be traded weekly, however these trades are ALSO CAPPED. Imo, the hype for this game was desperate and baseless, every hour of my gameplay I thought why this game was any different from other MMO's and I couldn't really find an answer. The pay to win argument is false due to the pvp being equalized for all players, but that doesn't change the fact that if you want to progress faster in terms of PVE you have to pay. Let's be honest here, the main motivation behind MMO's is progressing, most of the times, even if combat feels boring you push through because you want to progress and become stronger. The game stops you from doing so which, in my opinion, is frustrating and stupid. TLDR, servers are extremely bad, PVE is underwhelming, repetitive and capped, PVP, in the current state, has classes that clearly outshine others, with some of them being completely useless. (If you want a game to bust your kneecaps and stop you from progressing just go play genshin impact kek)*If you like the game, keep playing, just wanted to share my ""unpopular"" opinion (68% positive reviews)*								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1599340,19-Feb,76.6,70.9

I kinda just wanted to see what the heck it was. I have to give it a positive review though. While the... premise.. is what it is, the card based gameplay is genuinely interesting and fun. I would recommend looking at the workshop for more and better cards though. Managing the various.. ahh.. resources available is also a decent challenge so it doesn't feel like you're just endlessly clicking through things to get to the next ""scene"".There are some negatives though. There is no 3440*1440 resolution option, the FOV is annoyingly low (you can apparently get bonuses that increase the FOV by very small increments), and the refresh rate has to be pretty low. I haven't had an FPS counter up while playing yet but after about an hour or so my eyes need a break and if you are sensitive to it it could give you a headache after a while. There seems to be a minor bug in that if you play certain cards with animations that interrupt the turn you can't click any cards or end turn until the animation completes.In the ""would be nice"" category I would prefer if more effort were put into the various scenes available (higher res, more realistic, etc though I also get that there is a definite artistic style to this and that could be  seen as a legit reason to have them as is). You can click past the ones you have already seen but there is so little variety to them you eventually want to just skip past most of them but watching them is tied to one of the resources you need to progress. Also the ""Temptation"" card is fun to use but weirdly a lot of the enemies are immune to it, presumably because they didn't do the necessary animations, yet those same enemies do have end scenes if you win the battle. Also can get a little grindy after a while. Not mobile ""You work for us now"" grind, but enough to get old. Having 4 mana to start and a few more health gain cards would really help smooth that out I think.Overall this is genuinely fun to play and there is more to it than you probably think.

The art and music are really beautiful and you will actually feel bad when you zoom out for the sake of seeing where villages, ruins, and anomalies are. The difficulty scale takes a little getting used to and you have to be a little careful getting to know which quests to take on and which to not worry about. When I was first starting out I sort of rushed a faction quest that expects you to be a lot higher level in the game in terms of units and weaponry so it spawned a scripted army right on my city that I had absolutely no way of dealing with. That can be maddening at first but once you get a feel for things it's fine. Be patient, enjoy the ambiance.

Compared to CK2 there's a lot you might miss, but CK2 has been out there a while with a lot of expansions to it. Now, like a lot of people into PDX games I have to join the chorus on saying I really have a distaste for their expansion and DLC model. While you don't *need* them, they do what they can, I think purposefully, to make you really feel like you're missing a lot without them. They have a history of taking elements of what was in the base game, then moving that and expanding on it in a DLC to where the base game doesn't function the way it once did. Not that you can't still play and have fun, but it's annoying.I would always recommend PDX games but definitely wait for a big sale to pick up most of their games. CK3 is in fact one of the few in their library that I would say is worthy of picking up sale or no. It's better to save some cash but if you pay full price I don't think you'll feel ripped off or anything.I really enjoy CK3 but one final sort of gripe I have is that I see people starting chains of events and storylines that I don't know how to get started and the requirements for the various events aren't explained in the game at all. Probably you need to read a WIKI or something and I would prefer if these events were divulged to the player in the game.

I picked this up on sale with the season pass for about $30. For that I would say it's well worth it. In game credits and ""scrap"" for crafting come fairly slowly and feels a little grindy to me-these are things you can buy with real money from the game store. You could also theoretically increase those items with some sort of third party tool... I wouldn't want to break any terms of service here by recommending something like that because it's a *cheat* and may not be permitted in reviews but freedom of speech is the *engine* that drives us in the USA, yeah? Oh, one thing really dislike is single-use microtransaction and DLC items. I am sure this issue has been discussed enough so I won't repeat what others have said, but it IS exploitative and inexcusable. But as that third party tool theoretically may exist... it doesn't have to be that big of a problem. Also if you only plan to play the came to completion once and move on to a new game, well, it doesn't matter really. That doesn't make the practice acceptable though.      Praxis is less grindy, especially if you get extra XP hacking and exploring, finding alternate routes to objectives, etc. I did a lot of side quests before I really got into the main story arc so they came a little slow for me, but once I started the main and got into it they started adding up. I would recommend taking L5 hacking as soon as you can if you don't mind the hacking minigame. Once you have that the XP from it really snowballs and praxis adds up.     I have honestly not gone far into the game yet but the story so far is good enough that I am curious enough about it to continue. If you read a lot of the emails and pocket secretary text you do start to second guess and wonder whose side is ""better"" to be on. The racism theme makes you think about things without (In my opinion anyway) being preachy or overbearing.     Performance-wise when I first started playing I cranked everything to ultra on a 1080Ti Strix OC and it was *very* choppy with a framerate around 30-40 at 3440x1440. I tried to lower the resolution and cut some less important (to me) settings but on full screen you could tell that menus weren't being displyed correctly, like the top and bottom of the screen had been cut off rather than resized. After some searching I discovered that MSAA is the culprit. If you have performance issues, turn it off. I am now running evertyhing on max with MSAA off at 3440x1440 and getting a pretty steady 60fps.      I played breach just long enough to get the free praxis for single player mode. It is otherwise awful and boring. Go through the tutorial as it takes about 15 minutes then forget it exists. They clearly just jammed it in to farm micro transaction money complete with ""Oh shiny card packs glitter and sparkle"" animations, obviously trying to leach on Hearthstone, but failing.     Over all for the sale cost at $30 I would recommend this game without reservation.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/337000,"30 October, 2017",59.1,41.3

They are both pretty simple, well made puzzle games with a lot of story in between. The puzzles aren't groundbreaking but they do require you to think which is honestly better than 99% of puzzles you get in video games nowadays. The multiple timelines and different endings are worked into the game so well and your choices really do matter, your actions actually have consequences and you feel it. The best part of the games is just going through all the different endings and seeing all the different outcomes. The writing is fantastic, there is an incredible amount of detail and depth when it comes to the storytelling. Sadly not many people are aware of these gems because they originally only came out on the Nintendo DS, but they really are fantastic games so I feel like I should recommend them. The English voice acting is truly wonderful, make sure you play with the English voices instead of the Japanese ones, you can tell the voice actors had so much fun making this.

Everyone who plays multiplayer seem to have too much time on their hands, but still seem like they just want to win for winning. Doesn't matter if you play on manual or normal, ranked and unranked is awfully unbalanced, due to the lack of players and actual consideration for a fair fight. You either fight a champion whose played the game since it was released and lost his job because of it, or someone new spamming the square. It would be so much better, if the devs made so that your opponents would be atleast close to the level of skill you are instead of picking the fighter whose ready right at that moment. And let's not talk about how furiating the multiplayer bug was on launch.The game does have some good qualities of course. The game has great controls, graphics and all together mood. It feels like a fighting game when you actually fight. Customization could be better and have more options, but eh, that's just a minimal problem I have.I hope more people would buy this on pc and actually play it. The peak player count at the moment of me writing this is 1243, With current players being only 89. So if you buy this and decide to play the multiplayer right away, be prepared for alot of unfair matches, especially if you're new.

I originally saw this release and thought ""meh"" then saw it was made by them and was suddenly interested especially since playing Metal Gear Rising: Revengence which was a great hack and slash.Pros: The combat is a nice mix of spammy attacks with the right amount of variety from different weapons to combos to learn and master.The humor and general situations are way way over the top. I was thinking ""what the hell am I playing"" more than once given how cheesy or crude the situation presented. The boss fights were a nice change between each other and very different overall. Multiple ways to play the game and lots of stats tracking for those who like to not take damage/get highest scores.Excellent story with many twists and turns.The ending of the game had me jumping out of my seat cheering!Cons: Could be considered corny/cheesy and over sexualized but I felt it really added to the gameplay and the whole story. You may not get all the weapons/items in your first playthrough unless you're actively looking for the hidden chests.The saves/checkpoints sometimes are few and far between on certain levels.Would be difficult to play on mouse and keyboard but personally never played a game like Devil May Cry without a controller.Would rate 9 out of 10 as one of my favorite hack/slash games.

Map is not as large, but its detailed and has new assets.As usual the quality of the game finish is excellent for an indie game developer, absolutely outstanding was how I rated the first game, this is almost as good, I found a few bugs relating to ore chunks not being possible to get them, stuck in rock face of cliff so that was frustrating when the scanner has a dozen of them lit up you can never retrieve, but thats the only bug I found in the entire game while playing it so as far as Im concerned the game is of an excellent quality.The story carries on from the original game, its not as well laid out, its order of process can get confusing but you end up at the same place eventually so its not so bad.If you dont love Marg in this game, your mentally sick LOL !She is a legend, and really made the story worth following, more interaction with her would have been utterly awesome but it was not to be, what you get though is pretty impressive, keep in mind this is an indie team coding this, and far bigger games with bigger budgets have produced far worse AI interactions in game, so well done to the dev team on that front.Heaps of people like to hate on this game simply because its not quite as good as the original, and because they expect every game to be built to their personal specifications, which I think is simply unreasonable.Some of the excuses include arguments about specific features, but all of that is just nit picking for the sake of making an argument.If you judge this game in a more scientific way, as a stand alone game, like everyone did for the first game, you get two great games that easily pass the mark to qualify as two of the best games on Steam outright.So ignore the haters, haters will always have more hate that empathy.I have I think about 1000 hours in both games separately and I thoroughly enjoyed both games, if only ALL indie dev teams could build games to this level of quality the Steam indie platform would have a much better reputation.So overall 8 out of ten, the first game I would rate at 9 out of ten to give comparison, Ive had a dozen or so folk contact me on Steam chat asking about the game so I drop this review for those and people of the future.I would rate Farcry 4 with a 10 out of ten, its AI is really cool.Just for rough comparison to a company with a AAA rating and a heck of a lot more recourse's to build games.To be competing with the likes of ubisoft or any other AAA company, being an indie developer, is an awesome achievement.But what really makes the Subnautica franchise rock the most is the fact its a focused SINGLE player game with a really good story that is pretty well laid out and what makes that so immersive are the data pads and the use of scripted parts of the game, cut scenes etc, and a heap of indie developers could take a lesson from that.I fully expect to see this story expanded on even more in the future, they may not have any games listed right now, but I see a continuation of this story in the future, I think the company would be crazy not to explore that and try to create a whole new planet map for that planet, in a different area of Alien tech not yet discovered, maybe humans discover a city for example and where that could take the story teaching us about heaps of the Alien history etc, but the door is wide open for a continuation of this franchise.I hope they do it, there level of quality in game development is really good for an indie team.Usually I would say wait for a discount to buy on Steam, but when the game is such a good effort, and good quality,  pay the full price, its worth it and it is not that much anyway at around 30 dollars.Highly recommend the game, great survival game, brutally hard in the sense that you have to do a lot of eating and drinking to stay alive, Ive played it in both modes, and I enjoyed both, but I did enjoy the second run through more on freedom mode, and I have about 600 hours in this one freedom game alone now, the first game raked up about 400 hours with food on, but I found myself rushing some things and not getting the most out of the exploration side of the game so just before the ending on teh first game I jump into a new game on freedom, not quite at finish yet so still have not seen the ending fully yet, pretty close though but it worked as a great incentive to want to keep playing, not quite finishing the game in full survival mode, mystery is the spice of life and once its answered the mystery is gone forever.Grab a copy of this game if your into survival games, forget that its underwater, I also thought for two years, nah that game is underwater how good can it really be, its  INCREDIBLE !I seriously regret my massive lack of insight on this, as a person of science that was really narrow minded of me, and I completely regret it and these developers have without a doubt changed my view on just how awesome a survival game can be, under water. I started looking at other games in the survival genre because of this game and the eye opening experience it gave me.Breathedge for example, brutal survival, not on a planet.....But it was Subnautica that open that door and Below Zero of coarse, So I can not recommend this game highly enough, along with the first game, and you should absolutely play the first game first, before playing this game, if your into stories, that how you should do it, in chronological order of the events.But do get a copy, developers like this we WANT on Steam, developers like this, deserve good sales and profits.If Steam had more developers that finish their games, with quality like the Subnautica franchise, Steam indie would have a great reputation, we all see a lot of hate on indie devs, because of vapourware which is understandable, but that is not these folk.One of my favourite games on Steam of all time.Thats a short list of a dozen.

La campagne :Je n'ai pas du tout accroch√©, trop d'explosions et un sc√©nario plus que lin√©aire pseudo-philosophique je dirais m√™me.

Ce n‚Äôest pas pour rien qu‚Äô√?l‚Äô√©poque Metacritic lui a attribu√© un g√©n√©reux 20/100. Sergey Titov, directeur g√©n√©ral du studio, s‚Äôest souvent illustr√© √† travers de nombreuses pol√©miques √† son encontre¬†: accus√© d‚Äôavoir sortie son ancien jeu en b√™ta alors qu‚Äôil n‚Äôest pas fini, de censurer dans le forum Steam du jeu tous les commentaires qui parlent de son jeu de mani√®re n√©gative, proposer des m√©caniques de jeu ¬´¬†Pay to Win¬†¬ª comme la possibilit√© de r√©appara√Ætre plus vite contre r√©mun√©ration, il a insult√© les joueurs qui campent etc. Pour plus de d√©tails sur ce sujet je vous invite √† regarder le topic Reddit intitul√© ¬´¬†The WarZ controversy explanation and full timeline¬†¬ª. Ce monsieur est un cancer √† lui tout seul, ce n‚Äôest pas pour rien qu‚Äôil a travaill√© chez Riot (League of Legends) √† l‚Äô√©poque mdr.Revenons √† ce jeu Last Man Standing. Amateur de jeux Bataille Royale, c‚Äôest tout naturellement que je me suis int√©ress√© √† ce jeu qui a l‚Äôavantage d‚Äô√™tre gratuit. L‚Äôinterface est agr√©able et √©pur√©e, la hitbox est correct et le type de jeu attendu est bien conforme √† ce qui est marqu√©. Malheureusement de nombreux d√©fauts sont pr√©sents et, in fine, me donne amplement envie de ne pas recommander ce jeu. Avant toute chose √† l‚Äôheure o√π j‚Äô√©cris ces lignes ce jeu recueille pr√®s de 50¬†% d‚Äô√©valuations positifs r√©centes, c‚Äôest faible et me laisse √† croire que je ne suis pas le seul √† penser de la sorte. Ce n‚Äôest pas parce qu‚Äôun jeu est gratuit qu‚Äôon n‚Äôa pas le droit d‚Äôavoir des exigences en tant que joueur, en particulier quand celui-ci propose du contenu payant in-game.Pour commencer les graphismes sont immondes, le gameplay est lourd et la physique √©trange, je n‚Äôaccroche pas. Le jeu ne propose que 3 modes de jeu, il n‚Äôy a pas de v√©hicules, on ne choisit pas l‚Äôendroit d‚Äôapparition, on ne peut pas parler dans le chat textuel, beaucoup de tricheurs, toutefois l‚Äôinventaire propos√© est assez complet (bandages, pi√®ges, armes et accessoires). Je n‚Äôai pas rencontr√© beaucoup de bugs. Il est tr√®s difficile d‚Äôengranger de l‚ÄôXP, beaucoup de cosm√©tiques payants et assez cher. D‚Äôailleurs √† la sortie du jeu √† chaque fois que vous lanciez le jeu un √©norme spam apparaissait √† votre √©cran, vous proposant d‚Äô√©conomiser 50¬†% de r√©duction sur le pack de bienvenue vendu √† 19,99‚Ç?au lieu de 29,99‚Ç¨‚Ä?vous avez compris¬†? Et oui √ßa ne fait pas -50¬†% si vous avez au moins un niveau de classe √©l√©mentaire. Pour conclure je vous conseille de fuir ce jeu comme la peste, pour ma part je lui ai laiss√© sa chance en y jouant pr√®s de 20h. Choisissez plut√¥t un jeu comme PUBG ou Fortnite qui sont nettement mieux¬†! De plus le jeu est depuis fin Novembre 2017 laiss√© √† l‚Äôabandon, plus aucune mises √† jours et de communiqu√©s en provenance des d√©veloppeurs.

The story - while it's quite simple, and it won't be throwing some crazy plot-twists your way, it keeps you motivated well enough to keep playing, on top of that the cast of characters is just overall great. Music - the soundtrack isn't as good as Warrior Within's, but it does its job well, its presence is felt, and it fits the narrative well. Gameplay - the combat is not as great as Warrior Within's BUT it makes up for it with the segments where you get to play as dark prince, other than that it brings a lot of new stuff to the table that wasn't present in the previous games, while at the same time keeping what works. Presentation - 10/10 this game is dripping with style while at the same time keeping the ever present Persian themes in-tact, the locations, characters and everything in-between just look so distinctive and cool it's been hard for me to find a game that's anything like it. Now, I highly recommend you play this BUT, the steam port of this game is the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?port of this game that I've played, and I've finished this game 3 times before, so I recommend getting your copy of the game from GOG.

Also, they didn't take one small thing from all the other MMO's.. A Public Testing Server.. As obvious as it might seem, that's something these money hungry developer's either didn't consider or just plain over looked due to costs / labor.There's been a cheating problem since the beginning and there will always be a cheater problem because instead of investing in an actual anti-cheat (Their current one is FairFight and it records statistics, all in-game bans are done by hand.) I seriously recommend you not play this unless you plan on cheating yourself because that is the only way you'll ever survive, unless you're actually somewhat decent at FPS's, which,  in that case, be prepared to be banned at random times because a streamer or someone well known in the community said you cheated.In the beginning, the developers stole their terms of service from League of Legends, banned people at random times to scare off cheaters (their version of an anti-cheat), and used fake screenshots which resulted in the game originally being pulled from steam. (Seriously.) It's for some reason been allowed back onto steam, and I believe everyone should know of this games terrible past and know that it's not changed one bit. Sergey Titov ""OP Productions, LLC. CEO"" (Previously known as Hammerpoint Productions) even went as far as to lie in interviews about this game, and delete any comments or reviews that said otherwise.

The gameplay is a very classical platform, all jumps, enemies, fire-spitting plants, wall jumps, several abilities unlocked through the game, some of which are original and add a lot to the gameplay.The only downside, sometimes the gameplay is a bit frustrating. Too many jumps are tight to the limit, which is good sometimes, but other times it's just pointless. The first time you play, you'll die from 600 to 1000+ times, really sometimes you repeat the same part over and over even 10-20 times.

2200,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044388199/recommended/,Other,10,Recommended,0,0,"I feel like I have enough game time to give a fair review now.First off, good game. It still has some issues in stability and mechanics, but in terms of gameplay and possibilities, it sure presents a lot of fun and opportunities. But all reviews got to contain some critique for them to be useful. So here we go.The fact that the outside atmosphere has any effect on you while you're wearing a spacesuit with its oxygen supply is very confusing. I am of course referring to pneumonia you get in caves due to air humidity. I feel like this doesn't make much sense since you are in an enclosed suit with no access to outside air and stuff. I have gotten the idea that the air is toxic and therefore other animals can live there unharmed, and you don't instantly choke when you run out of oxygen. But because some of the animals living there are completely normal animals it makes this mechanic feel like a cheap excuse to make it ""space-related"". I won't complain too much about this, but making all the animal's something unique would make it more believable. Either just mutated versions or completely new species. This is a PVE game, but it feels much more like EVP. When you enter the snowy mountains in the ice expedition chapter, the blizzard starts upon first entry, and not just randomly. It stopped the moment I left and started the moment I went back in. It feels more like some parts of the environment are programmed to destroy you or to make your life difficult. And it doesn't feel authentic. A harsh environment is one thing, but I feel it can be RNG-based and not programmed specifically to location and objective. The very first mission just spawned bears or wolves out of the blue on top of the scanner to make it more difficult. And that is not PVE I feel like. That's EVP, which is not what was promised. Ruins the immersion a bit. I also don't like the way stamina, debuffs, and some of that stuff work and react with each other, as much of it don't make any sense, but I understand that it's a game and that it is to make the game more challenging, but I also feel that it can be done in a better and more immersive way. Conclusion: It's a game with many possibilities and the gameplay drags you out of reality and suddenly you've spent 8 hours in-game without realizing it. So the game is not bad per se, but it got a lot of things that can be improved to make it even better. I recommend it purely because the game is rich in content and possibilities.

But if there is a big forest fire going on, they drop down to 20-40 depending on how close I am, and of course the amount of fire going on. As for me the only con I have so far;The game does feel a bit narrow as you're in a valley of mountains surrounded on either side in the forest biome (not sure how it is outside this biome as I haven't gotten there yet.) But especially so far it feels narrow as you only have a set of way to travel, it don't take long to go to one side of the mountain side to the other. If they had expanded it further so it don't feel so narrow, I'd feel much more immersed and epsecially if they made it like other open world games, look at BotW for instance, huge world and many ways to travel around. Where as here it's just one set of a path you can take, either forward or backwards, as the sides are blocked off with a huge mountain.However I do really enjoy this game and it's mechanics, building houses is easy and fun, you can place the pillar for support of the house where ever you want, it's not limited to a set place, once you place the first one, you can then use that to get a grid and place them accordingly to fit the grid of where that pillar is. Overall I give this game a 7/10. Visiually gorgeous and stunning. The survival elements and mechanics is just where this game really shines from other survival genres in my opinion.

The ship combat reminds me of Gimbal. The customization is pretty good. I don't like the lack of camera rotation or see through walls for desiging ships however. The devs are very responsive to feedback.  While limited I find the story to be very good so far.Below I will do a list of pros, neautral and cons.Pros:Potential is high. Very high. This game is indie game of the year level potential.The story is great albeit very limited. A few spots you can tell it's very work in progress but it is a very basic implementation.The flight mechanics are great. The use of travel ""lanes"" and warp gates reminds me of freelancer. I love it.The combat is great! I wish there as more weapons and bigger ships but overall it's great so far.The environment is wonderful and gorgeous! I love the ice field. Again it reminds me of Freelancer.Neutral:The graphics are decent. Not triple a and not minecraft voxel ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô? Overall they work though.The game when I last played had some serious bugs. It is early access so it's expected but these were game breaking where I had to reload saves. I will remove this as the game progresses if I see the bugs fixed or move it to negative if it laucnhes with them in tact.Bad:The ship design has some flaws. It's hard to see through walls for placing stuff and I don't like the very limited ship layouts. it makes for only a few designs being good for gunboats/heavy fighter builds. The rest being good for cargo... maybe?Overall it's a great game so far that I highly recommend with the caveat that it's clearly in an alpha state.

I do however see some minor issues and some things that I just feel are outright missing. I do reccommend this game however as it is very playable and fun in the current form which is rare for early access.Pros:Mechs, gundam style.Graphics are amazing. Best unity engine graphics I have ever seen.Executions.Mostly customizable units. You can customize every part. Including the sword and shield. I just wish you could change the guns out. Sadly they are tied to the respective part (arms for small/missles, chest for heavy). However it still has some very deep customization. You can even change the color/flair of the unit.Missions are fun yet not too hard. I have only played on normal but the missions were easy yet tough enough to make me think.Survivial mode. I love this mode. I just wish the rewards were given every time instead of for hitting x wave. However it's so fun trying to beat the highest score.Cons:Repetitive. The game can get pretty repetitive and there seems minimal diffrence besides stats between the 3 unit types. I wish there was more cosmetic differences.  However this has not kept me from enjoying this game for hours.Lack of co-op is sad. I would love to do the survival mode with a friend on this. It would be so fun competing to see who could get more kills etc.TLDR: Game is very fun especially for an early access game. Could use some more options and game modes and co-op but in general is a great game. I highly recommend it.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/630030,"17 August, 2017",9.5,8.1

But me and my friend built a pretty descent base and spent 60 hours building it. Then our town internet cut out for two days. When we came back, our 60 hours worth of farming and building was gone because of this new decay system, only tc remained and our metal floors. Before it was good because it was essential for you to come on but not farm for two hours in order to maintain your base. Maybe 6 months ago the game was really fun to play and once you got the resources you could build anything you want. Then they added components which were really interesting and fun to use. It made it harder to craft things like aks which was a good change. Then they added xp system which was pretty bad in my opinion. Then they added blueprints with components. Blueprints were removed before which almost everyone cheered for. Then they decided to add it back with the components system. So now it takes a whole wipe to get a c4 and then you can't use it because everyones got 3 layer honecombed bases. It is literaly just a guessing game in order to get the part that you want unless you steal it off someone else with the melee weapons you find in component chests (which is very possible because people are vegies and dont know how to aim). In my opinion if they remove the 100x speed decay (what it feels like) or slow it down and they remove or dial down the blueprint system I could easily give this game 10/10. It is a great game with active players and devs but I am just sick of this update at the moment.Although I sometimes find this game very frustrating you sometimes have those wipes where everything goes your way and you find this game being the best you have ever played.

I liked the concept and the pixel-art, so I decided to put it on my wishlist.I was happy when I received an e-mail a few days after that this game is available now. One day after I made the purchase, and I started playing the game on the same day.The game was right how I imagined it to be. A puzzle-platformer mixed with mystery. If I had to compare it to another game, I would name the ""Portal""-series.I managed to get 7 out of 9 achievements. Some were easy, some were hard to achieve. There are 2 achievements left, and I am not quiet sure how to get them. But I will for sure!I can suggest this game to everyone who loves puzzles with a small amount of mystery-elements like ""Portal"" and ""The Talos Principle"".Thanks for reading, and have fun discovering all the achievements and mysteries! :)								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1744140,"12 October, 2021",4.9,3.3

Please follow my Curator Page: Challenging GamesReview: 'Hold 10 Seconds'Full Rating and Summary at the Bottom'Hold 10 Seconds'; the first release from indie-game developer Blindsoft, is a deceptively difficult and somewhat reaction-based 2D-platformer that provides a unique and greater challenge than you'd think at first glance. GameplayThe gameplay is simple. You have three major movement options, the jump, the grab and later on, the dash. You have to use each of these tools to get across and on to platforms to avoid falling off the screen, trying to survive for 10 seconds. The platforming is mostly reaction-based, you see your next location and you figure out how you're going to get there, feeling like something akin to 'Super Meat Boy'.This simple, yet fairly effective loop provides an adrenaline-pumping or angering and mostly fun challenge.Throughout the game, new concepts and challenges are added to keep it fresh. Things like moving platforms, spinning platforms, gravity changes and even some weird 3D rotating platforms.From what I've seen, the bosses are mostly just regular gameplay, with a lot more intensity thanks to its harder difficulty, a test of the new mechanics you've learned, and the music.A problem, albeit a somewhat small one, that I have with the movement, is that it can feel out of control from the player sometimes. This is sometimes due to the sort of 'slidey' feel that your character has, although this can be seen as a design decision. Despite this, the controls feel tight most of the time.Another problem I have is that, when you die, the game opens the pause screen, rather than just placing you back into the level. This can really slow down the pace of the game, making it feel like a drag trying to get through levels you are finding difficult.**Respawn times have been optimized and made automatic. This makes the game feel a lot better than before. Thank you devs.DesignThe design is themed around a retro aesthetic, with it's CRT monitor border and scan lines and film grain. A problem I have with the design. There is not a lot of variation present, making it look the same for a lot of the time you play this game. Even just a few color changes would add a lot.Fairness/ChallengeThe game is mostly fair in its difficulty. It does not introduce concepts suddenly, or abruptly, and gives you time to understand how it works.The difficulty curve is usually fair and lets you get through a few levels to get used to the new concept with the difficulty ramping up each time.ConclusionPros+ Challenging yet fair+ Good controls+ FunCons- Not much variation in design between each set of levels- Pause between death screens slows down the pace of the game.- Alt-tabbing game can freeze it.Overall, 'Hold 10 Seconds' is a game that provides a deceptively difficult experience that is pretty fun to play and is definitely challenging. Although it does suffer from a few hiccups, and lack of design variation, it is still a good experience. And at only $3 USD, it's worth its price.

This instantly makes the game extremely fun, even though it is still bad.Difficulty wise, the game has a fairly high difficulty with a lot of tight jumps, further made difficult by the controls and movement physics.Overall Rating: 4.5/10Difficulty: 6/10 (9/10 w/ friends)Helpful?

It has a pretty great environment and a ridiculous, yet awesome three-phase boss fight. Also, if you care enough, then Ashes of Ariandel is somewhat of a setup for Ringed City.If you are only wanting to buy one and not another, Buy The Ringed City.Here are some pros and cons of each DLC to be aware of.Ashes of AriandelPROS+ Pretty great environment+ Awesome and intense three-phase main boss fight+ MusicCONS- Pretty bad optional boss (First phase is a PvP enemy boss) (great music though)- Pretty Short (~3-5 hours)- Occasional gank fest (lots of corners and turns)OVERALL, Ashes of Ariandel is a good DLC that is worth playing, if you are willing to buy it. It is more oriented towards combat situations, rather than furthering the lore of Dark Souls 3.7.5/10The Ringed CityPROS+ Probably the best Duo Boss fight since Ornstein and Smough+ Amazing final boss fight that feels worthy of the final boss of the Dark Souls Franchise.+ Pretty great environments+ Good length (~7-8 hours)+ Music+ Two major new areasPLAYER-DEPENDENT= Two bosses have ridiculous health poolsCONS- Gank fest at times- Another PvP Boss (actual PvP if online enabled)OVERALL, Ringed City is a great DLC that is absolutely worth playing, and has an incredible, yet satisfying difficulty with great bosses and environments, and does feel like a true conclusion to the Dark Souls franchise.9/10 ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/442010,"28 June, 2021",0,0

Either that... or run over to a friends house and play through a few floors because this game truly speaks for itself. ( Usually through horrifying flash backs, complete with blood baths or surrealistic-nightmare dreams or visions from people that may be gifted... or are just completely insane. But hey! At least they're complete sentences! ){ How do I know if I will like the game?! }:-If you're a fan of Kill Bill, Berserk, Pulp fiction, Django Unchained, Drive, or realistic violence in general, then you will absolutely fall in love this game. -Top down twin-stick shooter fans, this is your freaking moment! The variety of Gameplay Based on Character and mask, The  Puzzle Solving mix in with twitchy split second decisions could not be done any better then it is right here! And if your afraid of death because some friend told you or showed you that everyone is a 'one-hit-kill', why? When you die it takes less then ¬º of a second to start the level over again, meaning that while you are able to fail, It won't be for long before you turn into that amazing bad ass in the movies, a tornado of death and destruction causing a complete massacre from room to room on a floor full of 20 people or more.-If you like the Techno, Electronic Dance Music, or club music of the present day OR 80's AND you have been looking for a couple new tracks, ones that perhaps just feel a bit more... updated. Then look no further! This is your sound track. The one you will be jamming out to for the next YEAR. With 49 tracks from varying artists, it nicely translates over to around 3 hours and 18 minutes of insanely epic music to murder by. (My current personal favorite would have to be 'In the Face of Evil by Magic Sword' which I have been listening to on loop while writing this review and yes! I have an adrenaline rush going right now too!)-Do you like Indie Games and love supporting people that make content which may not appeal to everyone?.... Then why are you wasting your time reading this?{ When SHOULDN'T I get Hotline Miami?! }:-Oh dear, you're squeamish you say? Please pick up your belongings and exit stage left. This game, despite its somewhat SNES looking style, is not for the faint of heart. Necks will be slit, heads bashed in with, like, the brain just... dripping out, and stomachs will be blown open! With shotguns! -You aren't and have never been a fan of Twitchy fast paced games. While I may have said before that you can try a level over and over and over again as if nothing every happened, there is this slight bit of randomness to it. Not everything is always exact which adds that slight split second decision making which you will eventually have to have, to some extent.-You hate any sort of electronic music. This is a big one because it's constantly droning on in the background so... yeah. You may want to watch some gameplay first before you make your decision. However, you can always just configure the game so the music doesn't play... eh?-You hate stories in games that seem to be all over the place with tons of characters all doing different things to either reach a goal or just survive.-You aren't a fan of 'the Surreal' and find nightmares or/and visions of the future to be just a bit clich√©. -Last but definitely not least, you just have no heart and soul, and for some reason you want to be the hipster of the hipsters and so, you don't want to play Hotline Miami 1 or 2 because you are deterred by how passionate the fans of the people are who play this game. You soulless sack... of waste...go die.Sorry about that last part but in all honesty, that was me not being biased or at least as minimal as possible. This game really IS one that I personally think that EVERYONE should try out at least once in there life time. (And in all honesty, one that most people should own too.) So, for Hotline Miami 2: Wrong Number... for the first time ever: ***** PERFECT ‚Ä?10/10 *****And... I think this may be the only game on steam that I will EVER give this rating to. Don't get me wrong, there are a TON of really great games out there that are totally worth playing but... this game somehow transcends above and beyond the sum of it's parts.

If you are someone that 'needs' a good story with their indie game, you might want to look elsewhere. This is a game that is all about style. With its odd look of Cyber Punk-Fantasy and loud Dubstep blaring in the back ground to get your adrenaline running. Savant is more akin to games such as Realm of the Mad God or even Hotline Miami. With its tight controls and literally taking no time to lean. It‚Äôs an 'aim with the mouse cursor' game, a game that is fast to get into, and even faster to get out of. Finally, while it may not be as hard as Hotline Miami, Savant is still pretty challenging. But that is exactly why I would still suggest picking it up. I mean... its only 2 dollars!

How this starts is with your character winning the labor lottery, yay? At the beginning of everyday you read the newspaper and depending on what is happening in the world, it will directly affect your game play. But, at the same time, you are an immigration inspector and your job is to control who gets to enter the country. So with rebels and recitalists teeming everywhere, your game play controls the future of the country, so what you do today in the game will heavily affect tomorrow. Aside from general mechanics though, the story is great and at times shocking. The characters have a sense of grit and feel real to the point where you will feel like the bad guy multiple times. And finally, believe it or not, the world is immersive. There are people from other countries and at that desk of yours, no matter whom they are, they are at their most venerable state. Buy this game; seriously, it‚Äôs an addictive experience you won‚Äôt regret it.One last note:This is NOT a point and click. Trust me, some people would like to call it that but there are too many other things going on, and with no clear goal because the game has 20 different endings most people are calling it an 'Adventure Game'.Have fun!

No? WELL TO F***ING BAD! This game looks like it could have ran on the Super Nintendo with its colorful art style, aside from all the blood, and guts... and occasionally brains! This game is messed up! And you never quite know what‚Äôs going on in this world. You just get oddly coded messages on your phone that essentially tell you to go murder people. So that‚Äôs what-cha you do! The best part about this game is finishing an area that has frustrated you TO NO END. There isn‚Äôt a certain amount of lives so when you die you just restart the entire floor of the house you‚Äôre in. The houses can be filled with up to, maybe even more than 20 guys. And your character can die just as easily as them, if not, even easier. Sometimes you have to finish enemies off by bashing their heads into the floor over and over again or shoving your thumbs into their eye sockets (Gross)! But when it comes to you, one hit and you‚Äôre a dead man. You‚Äôre no Master Chief sitting behind a rock waiting for your shield to charge back up. The game is extremely unforgiving. When you lose, everything resets. And when you enter a room with people in it, no matter the number, you better be FREAKING FAST and make sure to kill the GUY or GUYS with the GUNS FIRST! When you win, you‚Äôre a god among men! When you lose, well the way that the game will depict your dead pixelated corpse with its blood and parts of his brain all over the floor, pretty much says it all on its own.So if you like buckets of pixelated blood, feeling like a one man tactical genius army, and being a psychotic merciless mercenary from the 80‚Äôs.

It has gotten to the point where it is so absurdly repetitive that I am not sure I can force myself to get through the whole game anymore. x.x I want to say great things about how well made the game is but in about 10 hours of gameplay you will be sick of playing this and beg for content I promise you that. And here are the major reasons why.SHALLOW REPEATING GRINDY CONTENTLet me give you a breif rundown of the content you can expect in this game so I don't sound like I am rambling to much. There are 3 guns in the game, a close range but risky shotgun, a high fire rate but inaccurate smg and a slow but powerful pistol, that's it, each tier they just look cool and have better numbers. There are 4 zombie enemies in the game and 2 bug type enemies and a wiggly thing, all of them you can combat perfectly by running backwards and holding down the shoot button, that is litterly the only tactic you need in the game, each tier they just get tougher and look different. As for the base? It always looks the same, you always need to micro it the same, nothing ever changes, you just tediously micro the power, repairing the core, research and build new stuff, once you have done it once or twice that is it, the micromanagement in the game will only become monotonous from that point on. There are 4 tiers of doing all this same stuff over and over, grinding like crazy like your in some kind of MMORPG before you are 'allowed' to beat the game, you tell me if that's not repetitive and heck or not.It's truly disheartening when the game will always be the same way no matter how many hours you burn into it and no matter how good and experience you get with it's mechanics, the same tiny amount of content is all it has to offer you when you truly just wish for more. After the first 10 hours you will have experienced all the fun the game can offer you and after that it's only 10-20 more hours of the exact same thing over and over again... same guns, same equipment, same freaking dumb zombie enemies, it truly becomes a chore. This could have easily been fixed if it wasn‚Äôt so darn long and monotonous. =/MAKING PROGRESS IS A MASSIVE CHORE After 20 hours of gameplay I barely even moved past the -first- tier, I don't even know how that's possible but the first three starting locations just took so freaking long due to having to go back and forth on the train for oxygen, thermal or to drop off loot due to having crappy starting equipment. The only way to do this less is to get to the next tier, which would be simple... if I knew where the data chips to do that even where! The first two chips I found which took going through and entire location each where for the farm and mine which are useless without teir 2 engineering and research and by the time I even found those I was sick of the game already and furious that I found those last. This happened because the game doesn‚Äôt tell you where the chips you want/need actually are, only hinting to where chips might be in story journals so I was mostly a lost sheep hitting my head against the wall for hours and actually getting almost nowhere. The tier system in this game is laboriously slow and very poorly planned, I would have preferred if they rail roaded me along a linear path so I was getting the upgrades I needed first to actually make progress, instead they bomb you with a pile of places you can go to, no hint to where are better places to go, you go to them, waste tons of time going through them just to end up with no idea where to go next after doing them anyway and not having the chips you need to tier. Anyone can admit this is a awful system and makes no sense, if I didn't get annoyed enough to look up a guide to a location I -should- have been at I probably would have never got to tier 2 and been overrun with 'space zombies' even faster then I did after 20 hours of wasted time and having to give up as every location was overrun by that point and it was taking to long to make anymore progress.This might just sound like I was a clueless moron but I was just going into the game hoping to have a good time, why should you have to read guides so you don't completely fail your first run and have an awful time? Playing video games is my only pass time so if this happened to me then it can happen to anyone playing for their first time and that is a very flawed game.A MEANS TO AN ENDThere is nothing meaningful about playing this game so why should it waste so much of your time on the same monotonous game loop? I have no clue but the developer seemed to think it was a great idea making you have to go over the same shallow combat, enemies, equipment and base micromanagement for 4 long, slow tiers. I am so fed up with the game is just want to finish it so I can uninstall it at this point and that is truly a shame cas I did enjoy this game for the first 5 hours but that 'fun' ran out way quicker then I hoped and now doing anything in this game just feels like a means to an end to a very very grindy repetitive experience. I bet you anything if you made someone play this for a week straight they would go completely insaneSHUT UP AND CONCLUDE THIS NONSENSESure I got my 10 dollars out of this game but by no means should you ever buy this at full price, as I have already clearly mentioned there is not enough content to even justify for how long the game goes for before you can even finish it in the first place, even WoW is less repetitive then this game. I wouldn‚Äôt recommend this to anyone with a job, a gf or a life that's for sure, there is no way you will have enough time to get through it properly unless you follow a guide to a tee. Unless you have like 20 to 40+ hours to burn on 5 hours of game content then I would just play something else honestly that at least feels like it has meaningful content grind.Thanks for reading if you did, I am going to follow a guide of someone that has more patience then most sane people and move on in my life. x.x								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/340490,"27 March, 2017",39.6,39.6

Me and my friend managed to finish it on one run! The addition of gun/passive synergies add SO much more fun power to almost any weapon and item, it‚Äôs just so satisfying and interesting finding combo after new combo every run, making what would be normally almost useless meh guns into beast cannons. It keeps the game variety refreshing even if you are not doing great. Synergies and more drops at least give you a fighting chance now.The more hardcore players still have plenty of options to make their runs much harder while other types of players that want a reasonable challenge, like me, can enjoy how crazy and OP weapons and items can get with synergies. It‚Äôs good fun to have in small doses now with the update.

I can't even believe the developers somehow thought it was okay to have SO many unwinnable situations, again and again it keeps throwing things at you that are impossible to beat or preapre for becuase how the heck can you know they are coming? I've litterly given up at this point, catch a load of this BS. Your daughter suddenly costs 20k to be cured of her sickness, note that making money that early in the game is near impossible.Then right on that same mission, your son needs 15 thousands for school, are you kidding me?! Then your daughter dies cas you will never get that much money and everyone is sad, you can't pay the sons uni so he drops out with a 2k fine but then he asks you for an absurd amount of money AGAIN, 15k to leave the country and go somewhere else, then when you don't pay that, which you can't becuase it's an impossible amount of money to earn, he goes off and gets killed doing a robbery, gets you a 5 thousand dollar fine for being found out, a 1.5k bill for the funeral and 1k bill after that for paperwork. This has to be a joke surely, it completely destroyed all my progress on 3 unwinnable situations in a row and ive lost all ability to care or even try with the game from that point on, it just completely screwed me unfairly.What the hell is this game?! This game is nothing but a hopelessness simulator, all you do is chase your tail non stop, you achieve NOTHING, you can't make any progress becuase the game dosen't want you to for some reason. Every time you earn money the game unfairly strips you of it for no reason at all based on nothing you did wrong or could have known you did wrong. The only way to seem to get anywhere in this game is to just be evil as all hell and rat everyone in, ive been doing that alot and it still seems barely worth it. I've played this for 4 hours now and I still have no idea how to avoid the bullsht that it keeps throwing at me.It will keep putting you in situations you can't win due to having no prior knowledge to prepare and it won't do this a couple of times nah it will keep doing it -the entire game through-, I have no idea what kind of game design this is or why it's like this but it's actually not cool. =/ Obviously playing on the recommended 'challenging' difficulty is a terrible, awful bad idea, I haven't had as frustrating of a progress backtracking time like this game since This war of mine. I would almost pay 10 dollars just to not play a game as annoying as this honestly that's how aggrevated I am after quitting out when an old lady darts me in the head for a reason I didn't know I had, my character just admitted to something he did in the past and she kills you on the spot and there is NOTHING you can about it other then pay an insane 500 rep which I didn't have cas I needed it for cameras to do my job! I don't even, I could go on about these unwinnable situations all day as they just keep coming.Can't possibly recommend this ugh of a game, get it if your desperate or curious I guess but be warned, and play on the trainee difficulty for the first run cas I promise you it will be very frustrating and make not a single lick of sense, make you feel like an idiot and feel like it's wasting your time. =/If your curious to know more your welcome to message me and such too, this game has nothing but perfect examples of why it's frustrating I'm not just writing this cas I can't 'git gud' there is no way to git gud at this game unless you went through it like 10 times, found all the right choices and chose them in the perfect order, how the hell is that fun?!

I'm really good at it now, everything is balanced, everything is manageable and don't get frustrated by anything much then spammy AI so yea anyway I'm gonna write a short and sweet opinion review for this now instead to give it the recommendation it deservesThe goodIt's a very solid RTS nowGreat faction selection now if you buy all the DLC's, get them on great salesGreat unit variety, especially with the All Units modGood map selection now to keep you interestedRespectable graphics and physics engine even up to nowKept the not perfect but innovative cover system from CoH1Added new mechanics that you either like or don't, the cold systemAmazing community, great free mods and skins to choose from, including maps!Good game dynamic and flow through the early game, mid and late game tiersPerfect to play competitively or casual reallySurprisingly fantastic replayability, every single match will feel different if you change the maps aroundThe Bad:Doesn‚Äôt run particularly well, even on my GTX 980 with 32Gbs of RAMNo SLI support for a poorly running gameGame performance plummets near end of game, terribad optimizationBalancing can sometimes get funky, one month a unit can be great then useless the next month after an updateThe Frustrating:Oberkommando West can easily get overpowered if you let them, so don't let themEnemy AI on highest difficulty clearly cheats resources and unit spam most of the time, outsmart themDoesn‚Äôt save match XP if your internet is down or doesn‚Äôt connect to game server for some reason, always stay connectedThings actually just not making sense logically, but they do balance wise. Such as a tank with a powerful gun shooting a half track but it takes the shot and just drives away. Or especially, armoured cars and half-tracks being able to be damaged by small arms fire, pretty silly.Conclusion of this review war:As you can see by the many hours I‚Äôve played this game once you know all the factions and all the units you can hop in and have an RTS blast with friends or by yourself with AI. Caring about World War 2 history will help you enjoy this game significantly more of course, but not required at all especially since it's not exactly realistic in any sense, such as tanks and infantry having health and sometimes being really inaccurate for no reason.I give it a solid 9 / 10 really, it has the whole formula that makes a true, enjoyable RTS game and I hope Relic works on a third instalment eventually in the next few years cas it can only get better from here now that they have fundamentally fixed and added good variety to the game.

I recently just came back to read a useless pile of text I gave on this game AGES ago and feel I should at least write something way more helpful and meaningful to make up for that, just in case people are actually still buying this game and want more info to go on. As much as I want to make this review unobjective as possible I just can't cas it creeped me out WAY to much, so yea take it lightly and take into account many other reviews before making a decision please, that's how you do it, one review/experience is never enough to fully understand what a game is.And as always my reviews are NOT reviews in the typical sense, the word 'review' has almost lost all meaning on steam, just look at how many useless reviews there are on most games and how many are actually just jokes and you will see what I mean. Anyway take my 'reviews' how you want to cas I don't even know what to call them, written first impressions? experience reviews? Feedback reviews? Concluding notes? None of them are coined terms so I dunno.Why I did not enjoy this game at all:> Incredibly disturbing> Way to basic gameplay> Uninteresting art style> Absurdly repetitive> Makes you feel really... depressed =(> Will probably keep you up at night> Unfair death and progress system> Relies way to much on random luck just to win> Some enemies are to predictable while some are just so unfair> Odd game pacing> Rooms are way to small and restrictive> No difficulty setting for those that just want to have funBasic conclusion:If you hadn‚Äôt already realized how very dark, depraved and downright freaking weird this game is from the screen shots then here is a mega quick rundown. You play as a little kid in a dungeon of death shooting tears, blood and other gross body fluids to fight abominations to stay alive, getting upgrades that mutilate his body and killing horrific boss after boss all to get to the end and kill his abusive mother that wants to kill him because 'god told her to'. Yep that's uh, actually what it's about, somehow. Avoid this game if creepy stuff is not your thing. If incredibly high, intense and mostly unfair difficulty annoys you. If dying and losing all your progress time after time frustrates you or if relying on pure luck just to win makes you feel like there is no point in even bothering to play the game and 'be good' in the first place then read some other negative reviews and don't ever get this, Yep that's pretty much it.Just cas it's not for me at all doesn‚Äôt mean it's not for anyone I know that, I just like to warn people like me that there is alot to avoid if you‚Äôre really not into games with a super dark theme and humour like this and also games that expect you to put like 50+ hours in just to be good enough and know enough to actually win, yes im talking about you most rouge-likes =/. I didn't realize how bad it was until I got afew hours in then I just couldn‚Äôt stand playing it anymore for the reasons I listed above, sorry.0 out of be weary of this game.Shame I couldn‚Äôt enjoy it like all the positive review people did but it is what it is. Hope this experience review helped someone. Always happy for any feedback or discussion comments too.

Anyway I do have a ton of legitimate reasons as to why I thoroughly have not been able to enjoy this game even after 6 - 9 hours, read on if you actually care, do it for your own sake if you‚Äôre thinking of getting this.THE GAME IS WAY TOO DARN HARD FOR HOW SIMPLE IT IS! First and foremost I was shocked when I first got into the game how absurdly hard and unfair it was right from the start. I really can't express in words just how frustratingly awkwardly difficult this game is. I don't think ive ever even played a rogue lite this hard before in my life! And All I do is play games, even see my steam library. The small tutorial barely tells you how to make ships properly, what good weapon combos their might be or how things work, how important ship balancing and equal thrusters are, nope just the controls and how to put parts on other parts making the game seem soooo simple and casual, but holy frick it so isn‚Äôt. It doesn‚Äôt even explain for a second that there is a colour system for higher tiered stuff! Yea sure that's maybe a given if you know anything about game rarity systems but I wanted to express just how pathetic of a tutorial there is. Expect to go in very confused, blind and lost, cas I could never figure out fully how to not dire horribly to stupid unbalanced crap over and over even after 6 hours. It tells you nothing and throws you into hell, pitted against bigger beefed ships you have no hope of winning against without some serious fire power, which you hardly ever find in decent amounts, and expects you to get anywhere, it's just such a silly, lazy development decision to do that. I get the whole 'just jump right in and play and learn as you go! No having to mess about in a stupid lame tutorial' concept, it's an interesting one to keep using in indie games but not for every game, it's mostly only ever felt right to me in survival games like Don't Starve and even then it can be hard to justify such lack of information to the player to get in and actually be able to play properly. This kind of humiliating and frustrating experience I have had so far has all been on the darn easiest difficulty too, easy! I do not even want to fathom the BS and aggravation that would have to be endured from higher difficulty levels, I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy. This game is making me feel like such an idiot that knows nothing about games every freaken run I try! it's depressing and frankly not fun in the slightest. =/ The visuals of the game make it seem so giddy, happy and casual but let me make it clear that it really, REALLY isn‚Äôt, this game will kick your archsloff and it won't care how bad it makes you feel every time it does it. Your expectations will be blown to hell after looking at this game every single time you die, and you will die alot until your either fed up and write a review, like me, smash your computer to pieces or cry in a corner, either one.The devs need to do some serious overhauling of the game balance and expectations of you fighting higher level enemies to go up a stage cas right now it's just brutal and a joke. You don't have any other way to go up a stage by the way, you have to fight and absurdly powerful ship way higher level then you with way more firepower and armour and beat it, that's fine and all, if you were evenly matched with it, but you never are and never will be, so it's like jumping into a pit of snakes and dancing around hoping not to be bitten pretty much. I could go on about how stupidly, brutally unfair and hard the game is even on easy but you should probably get the point I‚Äôm trying to make. If you don't like hard games and were thinking of buying this well then I hope you were lucky enough to read this my friend and not go through the pain I‚Äôve put myself through to make a point that's not even worthwhile making. I shouldn‚Äôt have to ever prove myself to a darn game, it should prove itself against me! I paid for the flipping thing, if I want an easy run so I can actually make progress then why can't I?! I just feel ripped off so much right now and that even buying this time waster on sale makes me feel like a sucker. =/THE GAME IS FAR TOO SIMPLE FOR THE PRICE TAGThe entire budget clearly went into the art style and audio cas holy heck there is almost nothing to do in this game but shove pieces together hoping they work right and pew pew at other ships floating around hoping to kill them, that's it! There is almost no progression system either, you unlock new ship part kits by going up through the levels then unlock others by using new kits you unlocked to unlock the next one by getting to level x, it's actually frankly a pain in the tush cas if your new ship kit sucks and is made of parts that are almost downright useless, you are kinda stuck with them until you actually make it to the level it wants you to get to with them before you can get a better starting ship, what kind of annoying progression system is that crap?! Why not base it on kills? or how many parts you collect up? or if you make a cool big ship? nope, just boring get to this level and you get a kit. After 6 hours not only am I frustrated as hell with repeating such nonsense over and over, but I‚Äôm bored of it too and wish I had my money back to buy something enjoyable, ugh. The game may look great, has fantastic effects, voices and sound but my god the lack of gameplay absolutely kills it in every way, for me at least and alot of people without god like patience I‚Äôll bet.Death after death you rarely learn anything new because there IS nothing to learn new, the game is too simple, it's just float around and shoot so what am I darn missing?! The game will drive you crazy with it's somehow over complicated super simplified gameplay that doesn‚Äôt ever try to help you improve or LET you improve, it will just keep killing you over and over with bull crap and give you next to nothing for your wasted time, not a single, not a bit of advice, just a kick in the nuts and a restart as a brand new hunk of junk. If you‚Äôre looking for a repetitive, shallow rogue lite game that's hardly satisfying in any way, shape or form then look no further really!CONCLUSIONI could go on about all the exact things that frustrated me non stop in this 'game' but I ran out of typing room, darnit, so this will have to be it. I‚Äôm sure I made a point to a degree cas I sure would have appreciated a warning like this before I brought this stupidly hard game. Can't possibly recommend this game due to so much frustration, it's way to shallow and unfair and demands a level of skill that has no place existing in such a simple game. The devs really need to fix the difficulty curve cas it's bonkers. 3/10, stay away if you want to keep your sanity. x.x Get it super cheap on sale for no more then 5 dollars, cas that's all the fun your going to get out of it im afraid just for a quick reminder of how a video game can make you look and feel stupid.

Which raises the question - why haven't we found anyone like us yet?There could be a multitude of reasons for this and this game displays them in a fun and intuitive way and more importantly a well presented and easy to understand way! This game is both somewhat a strategy but mostly an educational what-if tool to understand how life may evolve and why the vastness of space is a large barrier between discovering other life among the stars. These reasons could be;.Aliens decided to never visit due to the difficulty of travelling across the void - perhaps they have more of a knowledge of Physics and our dreams of deep space traversal are merely just science-fiction. We're already struggling to tackle problems of habitation in low orbit and beyond..Aliens simply decided to not visit us. Perhaps we're no where near the scale of civilization that's worthy of contact. I would like some reference to the Kardashev Scale in the game..Other civilizations have only just recently become sentient or space faring and perhaps have sent messages or visitors that just won't arrive within our lifetime. The Human race has only been around for around 300,000 years - perhaps in the timescale of the universe this just isn't long enough for anything meaningful to happen.And many more questions and scenarios and even theories can be demonstrated in this game. For instance I had a species that was so militant that when they discovered other species they instantly killed them, akin to the Dark Forest theory proposed in the brilliant Sci-Fi Novel 'The Dark Forest' by Liu Cixin. Perhaps it's better that other species don't know about us...Or another game I had a harsh reminder of The Great Barrier theory, I had 3 separate races all who had to endure multiple extinction level events, some made it... most didn't. The Earth in it's past has had it's fair share of extinction events, perhaps that was our test? Perhaps we've surpassed the great barrier? Thanks Mr. Dinosaur.All in all, if the philosophy of alien life and the universe fascinates you, this is the game for you. It's still not finished, granted, but it's a fun experience nonetheless.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1543150,3-Jan,7.6,3.7
2263,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008251061/recommended/,United Kingdom,6,Recommended,2,1,"Project Zomboid is like no other Zombie survival or Apocalypse simulator on the market. The game combines tense survival gameplay with extremely deep and realistic mechanics that are perfectly embroided together, in order to create a satisfying and immersive survival sandbox.Project Zomboid is set in 1990s Kentucky, USA. With famous towns such as Muldraugh and now thanks to the recent release of Build 41 on the main branch - Louisville! As you can imagine a game that is trying to include an entire state will have a massive map and you'd not be surprised to find out that you can try and survive in a huge open map. You will need cars to get around effectively unless you're prepared for some dangerous multi-day treks through the wilderness in order to avoid wandering hordes on the main highways and roads.The beauty of this game aside from the sheer depth and learning curve is your journey to gain more experience each character. You will die, and you will die a lot. This game does not pull punches, the virus can only spread to you through blood and saliva transmission (Which is customize-able in the sandbox settings, more on that later). which essentially means, if you get bit by the infected - you're a dead man walking. Even scratches and cuts from the infected have a chance to carry the virus into your blood stream. But a bite? That's a certainty. Get your affairs in order and paint the ceiling with a nearby shotgun.The infected are dangerous, this is a constant threat, a constant fear. You may think the shambling dead pose not much of a threat, they're slower than you when you walk but in numbers? Or if you let your guard down? Complacency is the number one killer. Make no mistake, do not underestimate the walking dead. Remember when you start the game it mentions ""This is how you died."" It might take minutes, it may take hours, some it may take months or years but there is no hope for survival and everyone succumbs eventually. Whether it's the walking dead or something else - everyone dies. Which is why this game is so brutally good! At the end of the day you're playing a regular old joe. Survival skills? What are those. You just came from a 9 to 5 bucko!This leads me onto character creation. At the start of your save or if you join a multiplayer server (More on MP later). You will be prompted to create your survivor. Firstly it will ask what your pre-outbreak occupation and skills are. Some examples of which are;.Unemployed - A blank slate, you might be a lazy bugger but hey you have some skills that employers didn't find useful in society! This occupation allows you to pick and choose traits starting you off with 8 points to spend..Veteran - You were in the military, at some point. You've seen some stuff and walking dead ain't gonna shine a torch on Medina Ridge. You might struggle to sleep but slaying some zombies? A cake walk..Burger Flipper - Good news! Being a minimum wage worker has some great benefits when wage doesn't matter anymore! You know your way around sharp implements and can cook some mean rabbit burgers for your pals!.Burglar - Sneaky, nimble and able to steal cars. Being a criminal has it's perks even after society breaks down!These are a few examples of occupations and some perks that they come with. Alongside this are plenty of positive and negative perks you can pick and choose in true RPG fashion. Remember children, Smoking is a free +4 perk points! It's the 90s cigarettes and lighters are more abundant than you could even imagine. After you've sorted out your perks, you then get to choose your appearance or just randomize it. You pick your physical features and what you were wearing when the world went to hell. Clothing, traits and every in between is incredibly important. Remember when I said the game was deep? Well it simulates body temperature, blood vessels and clothes even offer different amounts of bite and scratch protection depending on the material it is made out of. Your hair? Yeah that dynamically grows as you survive and can be cut or trimmed with scissors and a razor.The longer you survive the more you see nature take over and erode man made structures, if you manage to survive to around the 6 month mark, civilization looks like it's gone full blown I am Legend. Vines, cracks and vegetation take over buildings and it looks amazing. Truly some Last of Us Post-apocalyptic vibes. This erosion also affects the undead. The longer you live, the more they degrade. I mean they're corpses after all, they decompose and break down. Unfortunately we can't pull a 28 weeks later and wait for them to die out. That won't cut it this time, but it was a neat idea!Thanks to the release of Build 41 which is a complete redesign and rethink of the entire game. Build 40 is an entirely different game. Some people may think that the devs taking 2 years to release Build 41 is ridiculous... but they redesigned and rebuilt the entire game's code and netcode back up from scratch and made the game the masterpiece it is today. Bear in mind that Build 41 has been playable in Singleplayer for 2 years, the main release includes final features and MP. Now this build is out the way the next updates are in full swing. Build 42 is set to include animals that appear in the world, such as deer for hunting or wolves and bears to hunt you. If you've been intrigued so far, well let me tell you if you're interested you can now experience everything - with up to another 31 players! Multiplayer Zomboid is a beautiful experience. It may not be as tense as going at it alone but it certainly is heaps of fun! I highly recommend it.In order to wrap this up I'll quickly cover the sandbox I brushed over earlier. Project Zomboid is completely customizable. The loot pool, the zombies, how the virus spreads or doesn't spread. It's all up to you. You make the experience you want to survive. Maybe you don't want shamblers and you want blind but lighting fast sprinter zombies with super acute hearing. You can do that. You must hate yourself, but you can do that. All in all, if you're looking for an immensely deep and customize-able Zombie Apocalypse simulator with incredible and realistic mechanics and now MP! Project Zomboid is absolutely for you. I cannot recommend this game more, I've owned it for years and to see what it is today, it never ceases to amaze me. This is the one folks, this is the indie gem for the survival genre. Infinite replayability (and it has workshop support :) )								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/108600,1-Jan,185.2,157.3
2263,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198008251061/recommended/,United Kingdom,5,Recommended,4,0,"Ready or Not is a worthy (Although not official) successor to the famed SWAT 3 and 4. Purely tactical, extremely tense and difficult but rewarding. This Ladies and Gentlemen is the true SWAT Tactical experience brought to life with more modern tools and approaches that we could of only dreamed of whilst playing SWAT 4.Firstly, I would like to preface that this is an early access review - the game is in it's early stages, missing content, features and general polish. However if you're interested in this game and are willing to drop the asking price, this game is absolutely worth it. Right now as of this review, I've only experienced the PvE experience, however a PvP experience is said to be featured at a later date. Biased as I may be the PvE is where this game is for me anyway.Which leads nicely onto the PvE experience. Ready or Not features multiple maps each with multiple gamemodes or situations, namely being Barricaded Suspects, Raid, Active Shooter, Bomb Threat and Hostage situation. These gamemodes are all unique in both the way the maps are laid out and the methodology required in order to take them on both effectively and more importantly - successfully. This game is HARD do not be dismayed when first starting out, you will fail, many times.Ready or Not features both Singleplayer with AI teammates and a Multiplayer element. The AI is pretty decent in it's current stage but does need some tweaking here and there, nothing unusual. They're fairly competent and know how to cover angles and perform room clearance without much input from the player. On the other hand is Multiplayer, up to 5 players. This game is an absolute blast with your friends, teamwork is absolutely mandatory and great communication is a gel that binds a plan together. I've not had a more fun tactical experience with my buddies for a long long time and this game certainly scratches an itch in that regard that I thought would not be scratched for a good while.Another thing that stood out to me over the course of playing was the sound design. It is absolutely FANTASTIC. When I use a breaching charge I feel like my organs have shifted, it is pure bass. It is glorious. It reverbs and it contorts through the environment, it does exactly what it should, and the firearms behave the same, it is amazing to experience. Albeit loud but hey it's 'mersion.Whilst I could continue to sing praises about this game, there are some downsides so far that I should address. (Please bear in mind that these are most likely already going to be addressed due to the early access nature and I'm really just clutching at straws here). As of now the arsenal and gadgets at the player's disposal is quite limited - I expect this to change over the course of development. I would also like to see bots as an optional addition in Multiplayer games, maybe you don't have 5 people and could do with an extra AI or more to order around and provide assistance. Players should be able to designate AI to be ordered around in order to fill extra slots.Other than to continue listing lack of content that is almost guaranteed to be added throughout development such as more maps and things of that nature, I'm going to close it here. This game is absolutely worth the money. You may see it and think that the price is steep, well let me tell you - it's a small team that has made a AAA quality product and their attention to detail and realism is exactly what it should be. People are not exaggerating when they say it is SWAT 5. It is what we've been waiting for. It is a truly tactical joy. I cannot recommend it more.

Snowrunner takes the series from being a tech demo to a full fledged experience, this is not just a driving simulator, it is an open-ended puzzle game. Figuring how to get from A-B when nature really hates you. It's an interesting dynamic of preparing and planning but inevitably creating impromptu solutions to problems as they arise. Stuck in unexpected mud? Use that winch and hope that tree is strong enough for your truck. Fallen through a cracked ice lake? Drown. Flipped your Jeep? Hope you have an autonomous winch or without that engine you ain't getting back up on your own. In Snowrunner the game consists of a large selection of maps each having primary objectives and side objectives. There are enough to keep you going for 100s of hours, easily. Most maps start out with you going around discovering paths and areas and repairing broken bridges, rockfalls and other obstacles in order to traverse the map with big heavy trucks, a whole lot easier. The main objectives are dependant on the map, and can lead from rebuilding an oil operation to building a whole rocket in a Russian cosmodrome...I've not experience nearly any of that yet, but I'm eagerly anticipating getting to it. At the time of review I've only played 6 hours and in singleplayer but there is a 4 player COOP! In COOP players help the host complete objectives. Players can bring their own trucks from their own games but do not progress in their own world. Although to add incentive to this, they still make money and XP from missions whether new or they have already done it.This moves us on to vehicles and upgrades. Snowrunner has a large selection of vehicles, from Big boy trucks to little boy trucks and scout 4x4s. All fun in their own right and each having an extensive upgrade tree. Upgrades obviously cost money but more importantly are locked behind levels, preventing the player from getting good upgrades and making the game a whole lot easier from the get go. XP is the name of the game and this sweet nectar gets you a whole lot closer to getting good Mud tires and a beefed up engine for destroying that dirty dirty, well... dirt.This game really surprised me. I wasn't expecting to have to use my brain as much but sometimes to solutions to your problems are oh so satisfying. I hope to have some COOP experiences soon, having other people helping would be great - but single-player itself is brilliant. Highly recommended.

Everyone who plays multiplayer seem to have too much time on their hands, but still seem like they just want to win for winning. Doesn't matter if you play on manual or normal, ranked and unranked is awfully unbalanced, due to the lack of players and actual consideration for a fair fight. You either fight a champion whose played the game since it was released and lost his job because of it, or someone new spamming the square. It would be so much better, if the devs made so that your opponents would be atleast close to the level of skill you are instead of picking the fighter whose ready right at that moment. And let's not talk about how furiating the multiplayer bug was on launch.The game does have some good qualities of course. The game has great controls, graphics and all together mood. It feels like a fighting game when you actually fight. Customization could be better and have more options, but eh, that's just a minimal problem I have.I hope more people would buy this on pc and actually play it. The peak player count at the moment of me writing this is 1243, With current players being only 89. So if you buy this and decide to play the multiplayer right away, be prepared for alot of unfair matches, especially if you're new.

Here goes:A fun not to complicated city builder that has put large focus on the political aspects of a state. While the main focus seems to be to build the city I would say it is to manage the state that is the main focus, taxes, legislation, budget, and migration policies will be the hardest part of the game to manage until you reach the endgame. Reaching the endgame (having answered all the political issues) will have most likely left you with a stable state. Some cons with this game, although the graphics are oldschool and somewhat simple, the mechanics should not be, the lack of shortcut keys make this essentially a game you play with just your mouse the only keyboard shortcuts you are given that matter somewhat are pause and resume (which both are bound to spacebar).  (I have been informed that the dev is aware of this and will I will amend this part of the review when this is addressed.) Takes a lot of tries to get the hang of it, there is no ‚Äúright way to structure your state and essentially every ideology and combination of policies would make a functioning state, although the game clearly has a prefered way of being played, a Capitalist Democracy seems at least according to my experiences to be the most stable form of governance. As it allows for a stable lower, middle and higher class growth. I would personally recommend  communist states for first timers as you avoid riots and can tax the ever living sh*t out of the lower class, but you will have large financial troubles in the beginning so use the bonds frequently.  The tutorial is not much help at all so I would recommend finding some Youtube tutorials if you can‚Äôt make your city work no matter what. I personally enjoy the process of slowly learning the mechanics and developing the most efficient way to structure my city, but it‚Äôs understandable if not everyone enjoys failing time after time. Look up ‚ÄúAndrewDangerously‚Ä?on Youtube for a decent beginner tutorial. Let‚Äôs look at the pros then, The simple graphics are nostalgic and makes for a smooth running game that can be played on essentially anything.It allows for many forms of player fantasy, you can name your city, give it a flag and there are several different ideologies Here is a quote from the games own website : ‚ÄúThe type of government is made of two words:‚Ä?An adjective that depends on the state‚Äôs Freedom score, 5 possibilities: Libertarian, Capitalist, Liberal, Socialist, Communist‚Ä?A noun related to the state‚Äôs Civil Rights score, 6 possibilities: People‚Äôs Republic, Welfare State, Democracy, Oligarchy, Dictatorship (low freedom score) or Anarchy (high freedom score).‚ÄùI would say these are somewhat biased and oversimplified, but that is to be expected from a game simulating politics, I am confident the dev did his best in this regard, and no matter who did the classifications, someone would feel they are misrepresenting or biased. The game has a simulated refugee system where people will either come to your country if the living standards are good, and you will have to accomodate for this, or people will leave your country if the living standards are horrible. You can either welcome the refugees or build walls and armies to stop them from coming in. There is even an option for space travel and you can build colonies in space, this gamemode is very similar to the one on earth but simplified a lot, it was included in a free update after the games release and that is very much appreciated since it is fun to sometimes check on your space colonies after you have developed your city. (The game is finished according to the dev since he is now working on Citystate II, so there will be no more major updates)There is kinda of a campaign mode, the region screen give your a large empty island that allows for 20 city states to be made on and you are given a map view of all the cities in the menu screen of this game mode, which allows you to marvel at your creations (or failures). All in all, I personally enjoy this game a lot and I have always been fascinated by city states myself so it presses the right buttons. If you enjoy a more relaxed and simplified city builder that focuses more on the state part than the city part, and enjoy the fantasy that this game offers I think you will find the price of 13.90‚Ç?to be a steal because this game can offer hours of fun once you get used to it.

I certainly enjoyed my first blind run through.Now, the trouble I have with this game is bugs and crashes. There are cosmetic type bugs that happen all the time that I'm not too concerned about; for some reason the NPCs in my game love to talk over each other during cut scenes, I don't get it but whatever... The crashes to desktop and even worse, hard crashes that force me to restart my PC are what really get me. I was playing on the weekend and the game crashed twice in an hour of play. That's not reasonable.When I played through the first time I didn't have much issue with it because of quick save and auto save. I rarely lost more than 3-4 minutes of my time. The problem now is that I'm playing on Iron Mode in which there are no saves except between map changes. When I got to Volga I lost around half an hour of progress to a crash. I quit for the day. Today playing the same map, I got an hour and a half into the level and got a game breaking bug; I went to use a lever, an enemy came up and hit me during the animation and then my view was stuck pointing down, my mouse was rendered useless but I could move. I could not fight back and died. What a piss off. At this point I had already downgraded to DX11 because it had been suggested in various threads on the internet for people experiencing frequent crashes. So in the end, it's a fun game with an enjoyable story, maybe others will have better luck with stability. If you like to 100% games though, this game may piss you off like it has done to me.*Edit*It's pissed me off enough now that I can't keep the thumb up. I got to the last 30 seconds of a map and it crashed (after having crashed twice before on the same map much earlier). I have repeatedly lost hours on every map now because of ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• stability. If you play this game, never do Iron Mode.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/412020,"10 November, 2021",84,71.1

Don't buy until fixes come out and prices go down.*Edit*Came back a few years later because I did actually want to try this game out once it was more stable. A few minutes into it and I find myself getting stuck at terminals randomly. Look it up... Oh great, this is because of my 144Hz refresh rate, which isn't anything over the top and new age. So I have to lock the frames at 60fps in order to play properly, but of course there isn't an option for that in game or the config files so now I have to download a 3rd party program in order to lock the fps. Still thumbs down, I don't like having to jump through hoops to play a modern game on my modern PC.Accidentally forgot to run my 3rd part program and had my fps at their natural state, noticed that the loading screens take half as long when my fps isn't forcibly limited... FFSAFK for 10 minutes, my Windows decides to turn off the screen despite the game running. Return to find a black screen that I can't exit. All the standard stuff doesn't work, can't get task manager to show or anything. Have to press my power button on my tower.

They've taken bits and pieces from all their past work to really make something that actually feels like its well deserving of your hard earned cash, which is a very rare thing these days.‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°ø‚†ã‚†Å‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†â‚†õ‚¢ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°è‚£Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£Ä‚£§‚£§‚£§‚£Ñ‚°Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ô‚¢ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚¢è‚£¥‚£ø‚£∑‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢æ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°Ü‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†à‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ü‚£æ‚£ø‚°ü‚†Å‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚£æ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£∑‚¢¢‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢∏‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ü‚†Ä‚°¥‚†Ñ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ô‚†ª‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£∑‚£Ñ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†ü‚†ª‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†∂‚¢¥‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ß‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£ø‚£ø‚£Å‚°Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢∞‚¢†‚£¶‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚£º‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°Ñ‚†Ä‚£¥‚£∂‚£ø‚°Ñ‚£ø‚£ø‚°ã‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†é‚¢∏‚£ø‚°Ü‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£¥‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†ó‚¢ò‚£ø‚£ü‚†õ‚†ø‚£º‚£ø‚£ø‚†ã‚¢Ä‚°å‚¢∞‚£ø‚°ø‚¢ø‚°Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ô‚†ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°á‚†Ä‚¢∏‚£ø‚£ø‚£ß‚¢Ä‚£º‚£ø‚£ø‚£∑‚¢ª‚†Ñ‚†ò‚†õ‚†ã‚†õ‚†É‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢ø‚£ß‚†à‚†â‚†ô‚†õ‚†ã‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ß‚†Ä‚†à‚¢∏‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ü‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚¢É‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢∏‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°ø‚†Ä‚†¥‚¢ó‚£†‚£§‚£¥‚°∂‚†∂‚†ñ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£Ä‚°∏‚†Ä‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°Ä‚¢†‚£æ‚£ø‚†è‚†Ä‚††‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†õ‚†â‚†Ä‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ß‚†à‚¢π‚°á‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£∞‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°Ñ‚†à‚†É‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚£†‚£¥‚£æ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ß‚°Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚£†‚£æ‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£∑‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚£¥‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£¶‚£Ñ‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚£Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ò‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£∑‚°Ñ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ß‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ô‚£ø‚£ø‚°ü‚¢ª‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†á‚†Ä‚†Å‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†π‚£ø‚†É‚†Ä‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚°ø‚†õ‚£ø‚£ø‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢ê‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚£ø‚†ø‚†õ‚†â‚†â‚†Å‚†Ä‚¢ª‚£ø‚°á‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚†à‚£ø‚£ø‚°ø‚†â‚†õ‚†õ‚†õ‚†â‚†â‚£ø‚°ø‚†ã‚†Å‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚£Ä‚£†‚°¥‚£∏‚£ø‚£á‚°Ñ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚¢Ä‚°ø‚†Ñ‚†ô‚†õ‚†Ä‚£Ä‚£†‚£§‚£§‚†Ñ								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1245620,13-Mar,123.1,117.2

Spill gasoline in your room (the smell will make the game more immersive)If you followed any of these steps, you're actually dumb. The game's alright if you don't mind a post apocalyptic take on the most popular third person games of the 2010's. Batman combat, empty-ish open world, repetitive side quests, but the car combat is fun. Every vehicle sucks compared to the Magnum Opus, including the Imperator though. The real meat of the game comes in the form of raiding bases, messing up convoys, and racing. The story is sub par and doesn't really follow the Mad Max formula. Instead of Max serving as a vessel looking into the world of Australia five years from now, the story is focused on him getting his car back. Sure, there's sub-plots in the game, but honestly, I was half-tempted to skip the cutscenes half the time because some aspects of the story became grating. The game's still fun though, and if you see it on sale for fifteen bucks or less, then it's worth the price of admission.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/234140,"8 September, 2021",27,26.2

The graphics are beautiful, the music is wonderful, the gameplay is near flawless, the levels are expansive and well designed, and while its replay value isn't as strong as I'd like it to be, it's only because I want to experience this game for the first time again. This is unquestionably a modern classic. More importantly, the story and the setting captivated me in a way that no other game has in many, many years. I want to make this a brief review so I can say that you're doing yourself a disservice by not playing this game, but I'd recommend playing through Blind Forest first if you haven't already.To compare how highly I think of this game, it's better than anything that came out in 2020, it's better than something like Symphony of the Night or Super Metroid, and it's better than most games in general. I would unironically put this game in my top five favorite games of all time. On a scale of one out of ten, it would be a 9.25, nearly a perfect game. The only improvements I would make is a better quest system and a randomizer mode for better replayability. It's well worth the 30 dollars, but it goes on sale for 15, so buy it then.

Less annoying ass rebounds where the goalie parries it perfectly into the attackers feet, sure they still happen but nowhere near as frequently as in FM 16. Defenders are now somewhat competent and don't miss an absurd amount of headers that result in the opposing striker 1 on 1 with your goalie. I don't have players handing in transfer requests left right and centre because I told our back-up goalie he played ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•. Oh and now you can tell a defender that he played ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• without hearing the old ""We all played ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, don't single me out!"" response.Highly recommend this years FM, feels way more polished than last years.

2312,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198070418551/recommended/,United States,10,Not Recommended,12,0,"As a fairly new fan of the Phoenix Wright series, I was thinking this game would be a good way to take a break from my playthough of the trilogy. It was something similar, yet it seemed like it would add a new twist to the formula. So I bought the game on the Steam Summer Sale. ...I stopped after case 3. $15 down the drain, and 15 hours of my life I will never get back. So where did it all go wrong?I'm going to assume everyone reading this knows the game's basic concepts, so I'll get right into my thoughts. (the TL:DR version will be at the bottom).For starters, let's talk about the characters. Most of the guys are complete douchebags, and most of the girls are bland waifu material. The only slightly interesting character was Kyoko, and I only talked to the others to get abilities to help me later on. I could barely stand any of them, they all seemed like they came right out of a cheesy slasher film.The friendship mechanic is also pointless. It doesn't change anything about the game, and to actually talk to the characters you want to talk to, you have to run all over the school like a chicken with your head cut off, trying to find them, while going through the room transistions that always waste your time. It's not fun or fulfilling in the slightest, I don't even want to be friends with most of these people.However, the trials are the meat of this game. So how do they hold up? Not very well either. Each trials is split up into minigames that will easily get on your nerves. I'll talk about each of them individually, but I came up with names for the minigames of my own.-Overly Glorified Cross-Examinations-These are basically where you use ""truth bullets"", which are basically pieces of evidence. This is basically a worse version of a Phoenix Wright cross-examination, except it points out potential contradictions for you, has a time limit, you can't stay on a single phrase for as long as you need, and you can't go back to a previous statement if you miss your shot. Yes, you actually have to shoot the contradiction. They try throwing in obstacles, but silencers deal with them instantly, so they're pretty much pointless.-Hangman's Exploit-Basically a game of hangman where you need to wait for the letter you want to appear, and then shoot it. Why do I call it Hangman's Exploit? Well, you can pause the game during this time, which pauses the timer, and so gives you all the time you need to think. So basically, the timer is pointless.-Rhythm Heaven Fever: ""I Won't Listen to You"" Edition-Basically, to get someone who refuses to listen to anything you're saying, you have to play a rhythm game. ...Could the developers not come up with something better than this? It's just frustrating, espeiclaly when it stops you from seeing anything, because I swear the music is not timed correctly to the beat. This game is supposed to be about wit, not being forced to play a rhythm game to proceed. I mean, I'm just going to fire a truth bullet at their last statement anyways, so what's the point of shooting down all their irrelevant statements? Plus, the game clearly says it's a popular vote to decide who the blackened is, so who cares if one person is throwing a hissy fit?-Freaking Comic Assembly-...I hate this minigame. I have a hard time telling what the pictures are supposed to be showing, and I just wish there was a caption on each one, just so I know for sure which one is which. It also throws in comic bits from previous cases to throw you off... which obviously doesn't work.The trials also did not feel satisfying to me, since I just didn't care about the story. All I wanted to do was get though it, and combined with the minigames, it felt like a chore, especially since most of the contradictions required such little thought to spot, even on the hardest difficulty. Not to mention all of the plot holes. ...So many glaring plot holes... it gives me a headache just thinking about all of them... Now, here's a list of some of my other nitpicks.1. Why are the characters talking about their escape plans in a room with a camera?2. Why does it have to take place in a school? It doesn't change anything.3. What's the point of telling me nighttime is at 10 p.m, when there is no way to keep track of time?4. Why does every room need to play a transition everytime I walk inside it?5. Why are Byakuya, Kyoko and I the only competent characters in the entire game?6.  Why are only some lines of dialogue commentated over, and the rest are not or have some genaric line or groan?7. What's with all the swearing? It gets really annoying after a while.8. Why is the layout of the school so confusing? I mean, there seems to be no pattern.9. Why is only access to the dining hall restricted during nighttime?10. Why is the blood pink? It just seems out of place.Overall, Danganronpa: Trigger Happy Havoc, is a disappointing game. The fact I couldn't finish it even though I tried to shows it. I wanted to see the end but this game is not worth my time. There's no reason to care about what's going on, the characters are generic, and the gameplay is poor. I don't care about finishing this game at all. Just get the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy on the 3DS, it's a series that's actually worth your time.(TL;DR)Gameplay: 3/10Story: 3/10Characters: 2/10Level Design: 4/10Final Score: 3/10 -Bad								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/413410,"15 July, 2017",14.5,14.5

The game has you playing as Stanley, an office worker who finds out that one day, all of his co-workers are gone. But the game is not just about Stanley, it's about the narrator too, and he can be really creepy. I'm not telling you how, you must play it for yourself. The game has 18 endings and all of these are reached by deciding where to go. The game also has subliminal messages, like that every door that locks behind you, in a way represents that when you make a decision, there is no going back, unless you restart the game. In fact, the game automatically starts over when you get an ending, with the message ""the end is never"" on the loading screen. So if you want to play this game, go right ahead.

It has hypnotized me to keep playing this game.1/10 RUN FOR YOUR LIFE!...Nah, just kidding. Time for the real review. After the abismal 8BitMMO, I needed a new MMO to satisy my online multiplayer needs. I was thinking about getting this game before, but now I have it, and what do I think? Keep reading to find out. Planetside 2 is a sci-fi, fps, mmo that has 3 empires (the Terran Republic, New Comglomerate, and Vanu Sovereignty), waging war against each-other on the planet Auraxis. The Terran an the defunked government of the planet, trying to regain control and make contact with Earth again. The New Comglomerate are an empire of rebels that rebelled against the Terran because they want freedom. The Vanu Sovereignty are a group of people who split-off from both empires, to make a cult about alien technology. The 3 empires are in a territorial war in which they take territory from eachother. The game also has 5 classes. The infiltraitor, light assault, combat medic, engineer, and the heavy assault, plus a max suit. All of these have a role in the war, it would take forever to list them all, so let's move on. The factions also have different atributes, the Terrans have larger clip sizes, the Comglomerate have hard hitting weapons/tanks, and the Vanu have lazers, LAZERS! I bet all of you just joined the Vanu because they have lazers. Anyways, the game will require a good machine, so those little kids with the laptops, i'm sorrry, you can't play without getting a very low frames per second. If you machine can run this with everything at it's lowest and with over 10 frames per second, like mine, you might be able to have fun with this game. Just as a warning, you will die a lot at first, so be warrned, you won't be isnsta-pro after you've completed the turtorial. The game is also team based, you will need to join a squad or platoon if you you want to really experience what this game has to offer. You can also get vehicles in this game. You can even rank up by killing people, or helping your team. The graphics are nice, and the sound quality is great. even at very low settings the game looks nice. The colors of the factions are distinct enough so I can see who are my teamates and who are my enemies. The game is an mmo after all, so the battles can get big. There can be explosions everywhere, infantry and tanks on the ground storming or defending a facility, and planes battling overhead. Also, you can buy new weapons and other things with cert points or station cash. It does start to lean a little bit to pay to win, because without membership, the free cert points are a nightmare to get, and the station cash is the pay currency, and yu might have to pay real money to gt the weapon you want, but with membership, cert points are easier to acquire, and you get station cash every month. The game also has things like hit Q while you looking at an enemy, and it gets a little target thing above it.The game has no AI, which is nice, and is FREE TO PLAY. So if you want it, you can get it right now. You can even join a little outfit, which is like a group. Overall, Planetside 2 is a great mmo, it keeps you playing and makes you want more. I give it an 8/10 GREAT								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/218230,"21 January, 2014",113,26.5

You also have to collect food, it should be obvious from the game's title.Also, don't think you'll be fine without a campfire for the night, you will die. Also, don't rush into a herd of enemies without weapons or armor, its stupid and you will die if you don't immediately run away.  The game looks great with its cel shaded graphics, and the atmosphere is creepy and mysterious. It also rewards exploration with cool discoveries, which I won't spoil. I also like the game's soundtrack, it really adds a lot of atmosphere to this already great game. It also has that sense of dread, but also the sense of the unknown. The game's sound is unique and interesting, an example is when your character is hit, he/she makes a weird lower pitched squeak noise. Also, if you die, you start over. Overall, I recommened this game to anyone who likes survival and exploration games. Its worth every penny, and it keeps you coming back for more.

Gr√°ficos at√© que bons, mas com o tempo Devem trazer uma otimiza√ß√£o para esta maravilha de jogo... O Positivo do jogo √© que voc√™ Tem o livre arb√≠trio ou seja, pode fazer oque quiser, N√£o se esque√ßam que esta em DEMO fase teste. Tamb√©m mandar as manobras com mais estilo e pegada, como um simples Flip que voc√™ pode chutar mais lento e encaixar direitinho na ""Base"", Mandar aquele ""360 Flip"" buscando com o p√© da frente, fora as manobras quase imposs√≠veis de mandar in real life!!.  quem √© Skatista Vai se identificar com oque eu estou falando, Sou Skatista a mais de 7 anos, creio que v√£o  gostar muito do jogo!

Recomendo a quem s√≥ curte o estilo de jogo, esperarem At√© O lan√ßamento ""Oficialmente"", com miss√µes, mapas, sistemas melhores de customiza√ß√£o e os krl. pois at√© agora s√≥ esta dispon√≠vel 2 mapas. Pois pra certas pessoas, poderiam se entediarem e acabarem pedindo reembolso ou at√© parando de jogar.... Recomendo a quem Anda, j√° andou e curte realmente esse estilo de jogo ou e at√© mesmo o esporte, que com certeza v√£o se surpreender com a movimenta√ß√£o, Controles Real√≠sticos, mapas e o Livre arb√≠trio dentro do jogo... V√£o se identificar bastante.NEGATIVOS!. Por estar em fase DEMO (TESTE), √© certo dizer que tem v√°rios bugs e desacertos dentro do game, Gr√°ficos um pouco pesados mas bonitos at√©, mas como eu disse com o tempo Devem trazer uma otimiza√ß√£o. N√£o vou deixar de citar a c√¢mera, que n√£o me agradou muito e n√£o tem como customiza-la ou seja pegar um √¢ngulo melhor para se jogar confortavelmente... Caso queira ter outras oportunidades dentro desse jogo, tem de baixar mods, al√©m de outros programas para fazerem esses mods rodarem, fora os v√≠rus... BUGS . ficar travado no ch√£o.. Mandar uma Manobra e do nada ( simplesmente do nada) o personagem se joga pra fora do . skate e cai de boca no ch√£o.POSITIVO! . O game √© √≥timo recomendo demais a compra desse jogo a qualquer pessoa, s√≥ disse quem eu acho que gostaria de ter (AGORA!) o jogo ou n√£o na na sua biblioteca steam.. O livre arb√≠trio que a gente tem nesse jogo, assim como no skater 3, Manobras super realistas, e tantas op√ß√µes de estilo, cada manobra √© mandada de um jeito, √© surreal a ideia desse jogo.. Dois (2) mapas que d√£o pra se divertir e testar Linhas e se identificar mandando manobras!CONCLUS√ÉO!! Comprar esse jogo fica a sua escolha, Dei minha humilde opini√£o sobre o game! Recomendo de verdade a compra deste produto, mesmo que esteja em DEMO (TESTE) Faz o seguinte, caso o jogo esteja entediante, jogue-o escutando uma m√∫sica de sua prefer√™ncia, imagine-se de que seja voc√™ andando com seu fone de ouvido, ouvindo um Charlie Brown... eu escuto meu lo-fi zin de boa jogando esse jogo, me tranquiliza bastante...

Some players are saying they are having low fps but I'm not having that issue but fps can be all over the place so I would turn down / off shadows.  Nothing seems broken or over powered so far and the maps seem alright for the most part. There is no three lane BS going on in the game thankfully. Has a counter strike style buy menu but you buy (with in match money) perks, kill streaks, and equipment (things like nades and flashes). You do have classes based off the type of weapon you want to use- rifle, sniper, smg, etc. Customizing your guns is the same as any other modern shooter. The loot boxes in this are not a big deal you can't buy them with real money or GP as of typing this, you only unlock them via ranking up and doing contracts. The tasks from contracts are doing things like get 25 head shots or something like that. The loot boxes end up acting more like a way to randomly unlock something that you can unlock just by playing. Most the time I already had the thing unlocked before I got it in the loot box. All in all if you like shooters give it a try, it's fun for the most part. The game even has it's fair share of kids calling everyone that kills them a hacker- so go nutz.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/374280,"17 August, 2019",21.2,2.9

At the start of act 1 and 2 and the ending of act 1 there are some good cut scenes that look very nice. which adds some touch of story to this hack n slash.Ability's/feats/what not- The ability's look amazing, each character has something to them that just makes you smile if that's launching a goblin 10 feet in the air and splat to shooting a wave of arrows and watching them die, each has their own little fun bits that makes you go ""hahahha dumb goblin ded.""Story- This is a hack and slash, the amount of story and lore they put into it is by far enough in my opinion. There's a good run up to who and what each character is with some lore you can read and at the start of each act if you take more then 30 seconds to listen gives you a over view of the level and whats going on. Its honestly, not as bad as others of stated.Mixed.Combat- This is going to be a mix for me, don't get me wrong its leaning more on the Pros side. But, there are times you're trying to MX11 a goblin but your move just inst registering and you're only doing a heavy or a light and its just not doing that amazing combo. Granted that could be im just not used to Combo style games and im stupid which is likely but Its a Frustrating thing time to time. But most of the time combat seems fluid and fun for me and 2 friends(forgot to add this. On occasion we have noticed if you have a lot of knock up ability's it dose not know what to do and will just throw the Goblin down at a random location that it seems fit.)Cons.Traps- in act 1 there are ice spikes here and there that you need the effect of ""Warm"" to avoid. Around where the sub boss guy is for the side quest while on the ladder over the spikes you normally run out of this effect and even when off the spikes you take damage but sometimes you don't? its Weird, but is none the less posting cringe.World- While the game looks and runs amazingly there are times where in the middle of combat or you're running around you'll clip into a door and be stuck or clip into a Goblin and get just minced, while each time i have been able to get out before i punch a hole in my monitor still aggravating at times. Glitches- Sometimes on a full team death you get infinite loading where you're ""in the game"" but stuck with the screen itself, can still move attack and be killed but cant see anything.Thats really all i have experienced so far ill add more as i play. Have been enjoying it a lot thus far and it is first or er second day of release now so im sure the two cons i listed will be touched up soon enough.

(May change)-Auto combo auto combo auto combo auto combo auto combo (please change)Summary: If you liked making your own combos in MBAACC this game will not let you have that freedom. 90% of your attacks will be auto-combos. If you're new to fighting games and don't know how to string combos, aerials and what not, this game is a great start. For more experienced players who love that crescent moon style MBAACC gameplay, this is fairly different. The game holds your hands for all your combos, it gets frustrating since all you need to do is hit one button to do a combo. Yeah you can do your specials but they're not your combos, they're your specials. Give the game a go, if you like it; keep it. If not; refund it.

It's such a unique experience that the reviews, gameplays, streams, etc can not reciprocate.

It's not shiny or glitzy and glamorous. It's going to need work and it'll take time. It has infinite potential though. Don't listen to a negative review that bashes on the game for it's poor FPS/Optimization. That'll get ironed out and fixed. You need to focus on what's ahead for this game. CDPR has supported The Witcher 3 for five years now. A card game, a T.V Series, multiple DLCs/Expansions on top of it's long campaign. Cyberpunk is in good hands, I believe CDPR will work on this game for years. They've spent 8 on it just developing it, why drop it now? If I were you I'd wait on buying, unless you have a 3060 ti+, you're most likely going to get FPS under 60.

The story is fun and the game is balanced and rather optimized. However, there are some things I, and others, don't like:GTA: Online is the very definition of toxic and isn't worth the pay-to-win grind unless you dream of bullying newcomers in the future. You will be killed repeatedly until you figure out how to do it to others. To make any reasonable amount of money you need a squad or you'll be left in the dirt, mind you, everything costs money in GTA. The rest of this isn't for Online though; personally, I think GTA 5 is unenjoyable without mods. Back in June, Take-Two Interactive sent a Cease and Desist letter to the team behind OpenIV, a modding software for GTA, with the hopes that it would severely slow modders from messing with Online. They have since taken it back, but the scar will remain; hence my negative review.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/271590,"15 July, 2018",288.7,275.5

It's a super fun side game for XCOM veterans, and a new experience for any strategy fan.I've read a lot of the negative reviews and most of them stem from the fact that people were looking for XCOM 3. This is a $20 game, this is not XCOM 3. Hell, War Of The Chosen was $40 and that was just a DLC, so this game is brilliant for the price it's at.Others had problems that the characters lacked good personalities. I disagree with this point. I enjoy the light, humorous, MCU-esque vibe that the characters give off and once you dig into the game, the interactions the characters have range anywhere from sad and emotional to mocking the XCOM franchise.The third biggest criticism chain (sadly) is that some people think it's SJW propaganda... because there's ""aliens"" I guess? And there is species discrimination? If anything the game is anti-racist (which is debatable because species vs race) so are they saying they are racist? Idk, it's some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, if you're a rational human being you'll ignore those blockheads. The worst part of this game to me is the lack of customization. Obviously you can't create troops but even the guns can't be visually modified and you can only change the color of armor. Maybe it will be something they add in the future or something a mod can fix, but it doesn't really subtract from the core of the game.I purchased the game for $10 when it was on sale and easily my favorite $10 or below game, maybe even $25 or below. 10/10 for price to content ratio, 8/10 just solely on content. Give it a try next sale if you are unsure, but if you like XCOM, it is not much different.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/882100,"29 November, 2020",38.6,7.6

The immersion to this combat can be very fun, but also very stressful which could be the reason why some people don't like it. The learning curve, especially as the game gets older, is super high and some new comers don't understand that going into a 4v4 player vs player match as your first game will not end well. The servers are buggy, but on good wifi, crashes only occur 1-3 times per 50 sessions (doesn't crash the whole game, just the match). Character balance, while not perfect, is being improved by the devs, and as a player gets more skilled, these unbalances go away. The community can be cancerous, but most times it's either funny or they are bad and you can mine salt from them. Vortexes are a major problem, especially in duels (vortxes are infinite attack chains). The devs have made little acknowledgement to this issue, but they are involved in their community on reddit, so the fix may come eventually.Bias:If you like medeival combat, get the game. Even if you absolutely can't handle multiplayer for some reason, the campaign has a pretty solid story and is a challenge to new players (and realistic mode is a challenge to all players). I don't see how anyone could not get some fun out of this game. Server issues are being exaggerated by a handful of players, and character balance is being exaggerated by new, salty, or bad players.

2356,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198141818637/recommended/,United States,6,Recommended,0,0,"After Season 1 left my heart shattered, I got right on to Season 2. While Season 1 was an amazing joyride of action and drama, Season 2 is the same joyride, but on steroids. Each episode gives you hope, tears it back down, and then makes you forget ""hope"" ever had a meaning. Review with spoilers:Episode 1 ended a little sloppier then the other episodes, but the action made up for it...in my game, you fight bandits, walkers, a dog, and you even have to do a little 007 around a house.   Where Episode 1 fell short, Episode 2 was there to clean up. You get to know more about the group that saved you, including their flaws, their strengths, and their worries. And despite their being lots of action, the most exciting part was reuniting with Kenny, who was one of the many characters whose death was unknown. Key things that made this episode special were the forshadow, the VERY important desiscions, and of course, the internal conflict with each of the characters.In episode 3, you once again find your charcater jailed up, but since you play as Clementine, you get to do all the risky infiltration to take down Carver's house of nutjob. IF you bought the ""400 Days"" episode, you will be in awe as you realize where the survivors of that episode end up. Episode 3 may not feel like as much of a roller coaster as the other episodes, but I assure you, the desperation of revenge really makes the episode unqiue. And by far one of the funniest moments was me screaming ""CUT THAT ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?S ARM OFF,"" as I attempt to save Kenny's girlfriend, only to have her die immedietly. Episode 4 is a mostly feel good episode after the rescue. Jokes are made, ""good times"" are had between survivors, and Alvin Jr is born... All this feel good only to have to make one of the hardest desiscions of the game. And last, but certainly not least, Episode 5, the episode that always ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?you up. It starts off with an intense gunfight, but the episode progresses to where the main threat for the survivors is the mental state of Kenny. If you are evn 50% attached to any character after the lake incident, you're gonna get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, because I guarentee you'll hate everyone by the end of the episode (except maybe Kenny). The only thing I can complain about is there not being an option to shoot Jane once Kenny dies and the baby is found. Season 1 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?you up by Lee dying, and you wondering what will happen to Clementine. Season 2 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• you up by everyone dying except Clementine, and you still wondering what will happen to Clementine. Although, there wasn't a season summary like in Season 1 so I'm waiting for that Episode 6 TellTale.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/261030,"22 August, 2016",8.5,8.5

Votre but est simple, en partant de z√©ro il faudra cr√©er la guilde la plus influente possible.Vous devrez donc recruter les bonnes personnes. Le jeu vous attribuera deux h√©ros au d√©part : Emericus, un garde √† la retraite, ainsi que Velia, une roublarde. Pour chacun vous aurez un pouvoir √† choisir parmi deux. Pour Emericus ce sera un gros coup de marteau √©tourdissant des ennemis en ligne ou un tremblement de terre ciblant une colonne. Pour Velia elle pourra soit envoyer sa pie infliger des d√©g√¢ts √† un ennemi, soit en marquer un pour baisser ses r√©sistances.Vous arriverez ensuite dans le hall de votre guilde o√π vous pourrez modifier leur √©quipement, chaque personnage peut porter une arme et une armure/objet. En fonction des statistiques cela changera leurs d√©g√¢ts physiques, magiques, leur rapidit√©, leur r√©sistance, etc.√Ä terme vous pourrez √©galement forger de nouveaux objets en sacrifiant les pi√®ces d‚Äô√©quipement qui ne vous int√©ressent plus. Une fois les emplettes termin√©es, il sera l‚Äôheure de relever votre premier contrat. Plusieurs seront propos√©s √† chaque fois, √† vous de voir lequel vous pensez pouvoir r√©ussir et surtout quelle r√©compense vous int√©resse le plus.Choix atypique, les combats se d√©roulent de fa√ßon automatique. Vous aurez juste √† placer vos h√©ros et l‚Äôaffrontement commencera. En fonction de leur position, divers bonus et malus seront alors appliqu√©s. Par exemple, si tout votre colonne centrale est occup√©e, les personnages plac√©s dessus auront un bonus de rapidit√©. Si une ligne est remplie, le personnage devant b√©n√©ficiera d‚Äôun bonus de protection, ceux derri√®re d‚Äôun bonus de puissance‚Ä?mais attention, s‚Äôils n‚Äôont pas d‚Äôarme √† distance ils subiront un malus de d√©g√¢ts. Il faudra √©galement prendre en compte ¬´ l‚Äôaggro ¬ª, basiquement plus un personnage sera situ√© devant et plus il sera susceptible d‚Äô√™tre cibl√© par les adversaires.Ce syst√®me fonctionne tr√®s bien et au fil du temps de nouvelles options apparaitront, vous aurez par exemple acc√®s √† des pouvoirs de maitre utilisables quelques fois par combat pour √©tourdir un adversaire, soigner les membres de votre √©quipe, etc. De temps en temps vous aurez √©galement la possibilit√© de recruter de nouveaux membres, sachant que vous ne pourrez pas en envoyer plus de 5 au combat simultan√©ment. Les autres resteront au rep√®re pour se soigner car √† chaque coup encaiss√© leur nombre de points de vie maximum baissera.Le jeu est divis√© en diff√©rents chapitres constitu√©s de 9 missions puis d‚Äôun affrontement de boss. Entre deux combats vous pourrez parfois discuter un peu avec l‚Äôun de vos h√©ros pour en apprendre plus sur son pass√© ou ses motivations.

Une barre de super attaque se chargera peu √† peu pour d√©clencher un enchainement d√©vastateur.

C‚Äôest √©galement valable pour les boss de fin de niveau, ceux-ci poss√®dent plusieurs phases et l√† encore en cas de mort vous n‚Äôaurez pas tout √† refaire.La prise en main est tr√®s simple : le premier bouton sert √† tirer, le second √† changer de dimension et le dernier permet d‚Äôenclencher l‚Äôoverclock quand la jauge est remplie.

(mais Rising Storm sera plus le sujet).Dans le but de ces deux jeu, c'est de rappeler au joueur le fait que l'on a que une vie, m√™me en guerre, et que l'horreur de la guerre, et qu'une tu ne recommence pas, tu vie, tu meurs, c'est aussi simple que cela, et comme dirait une phrase de This Is War Of Mine Originally posted by Ernest Hemingway (This Is War Of Mine):¬´¬†Dans la guerre moderne, tu meurs comme un chien sans raison¬†¬ª.C'est cet impression que nous donner ces deux jeux, et ceux, avec perfection finalement.Dans Rising Storm 2¬†: Vietnam, c'est la m√™me chose, lorsque que tu meurs, ta vraiment l'impression que ton personnage ne peux plus recommencer, il meurt, et lorsque tu meurt, c'est violent, rapide et brutal (Lorsqu'on se prend une t√™te, l'√©cran devient subitement noir, juste un ¬´¬†Bunk¬†¬ª se fait entendre, puis vous revenez au jeux).Simulator de simulationC'est donc, dans un contexte d'ambiance se voulant r√©aliste, que le jeu se lance, comme son pr√©d√©cesseurs.ATTENTION¬†!R√©aliste, pas simulator, il ne faut pas confondre, dans un simulator, on voudras que vous vous sentiez au plus proche du sujet du simulator, que vous prenez connaissant de ce que √ßa ressemble plus ou moins dans la vie r√©elle, bref un simulator.Dans le r√©alisme, je ne veux pas parler de ce que la plupart des joueurs pense¬†: Des graphisme r√©aliste  (vous avez vus la nuance!).La ou un simulator vas vouloir vous montrer un quotidien, une action quotidienne (ex¬†: dans Farming Simulator, on vous montre le quotidien d'un fermier, expliquer d'un mani√©r√© vid√©oludique)Un r√©alisme vas vous montrer l'ambiance, le contexte et la situations qui se rapproche ou se rapprochais le plus de la ¬´¬†r√©alit√©¬†¬ª*.*: je parle de ¬´¬†r√©alit√©s¬†¬ª entre guillemet, car c'est un exp√©rience qui se veut proche de l'ambiance, non pas du contexte ou de la situation, ce n'est pas comme si notre personnage avait une vie derri√®re soit, le jeu veut juste nous montrer a quoi ressemble l'ambiance et les impression lors de telle situation, dans ce type  de contexte (la guerre (contexte) = ressentit d'un soldat (impression) =  √©motions qu'√©prouvera le joueur (ambiance) ).C'est pas ma game¬†!A savoir que tout ce que je vous raconte se joue a des d√©taille  (les parole que peuvent dire des perso mourant, la vision se brouillant durant un bombardement, le manque de r√©ticule, etc)BON¬†!Maintenant que je vous expliquer d'une fa√ßon assez √©trange le message du jeu, parlons de lui de fa√ßons vid√©oludique et sans( ou peu) d'interpr√©tation (bref, l'attaquer comme un bloc)comme a son pr√©d√©cesseurs, le gameplay est en soit r√©aliste (attention, transition a apercevoir), on peut s'allonger, s‚Äôaccroupir, courir, viser, et faire le combo de ses mouvement (courir accroupie, courir puis s'allonger, etc).Cependant, contrairement au premier opus, nul syst√®me de couverture qui √©tait, j'avoue fort intuitif, ici, la couverture se fait en s'accroupissant ou en s'allongent, par contre, contrairement au premier, ils ont remplacer cela par un syst√®me de stabilit√©s de la vis√©e, qui est nettement moins visible, mais tout de m√™me pr√©sent.Selon si vous √™tes proche ou non d'un endroit a la hauteur proche du niveau ou vous portez votre arme, vous pouvez (de fa√ßon indirecte), posez votre arme sur ce rebord, pour viser de fa√ßon plus pr√©cise (sans que cela bouge tout seul).Dans le gameplay, c'est tout, a par la conduite d‚Äôh√©licopt√®re qui est franchement bord√©lique, je sais pas comment certain arrive a se poser l√† ou moi, je gal√®re a tourner. (et aussi le respawn entre chef d'escouade et tunnel, mais bon, c'est un principe simple)J'aime l'odeur de mon PC au petit matinFinie la guerre du pacifique du second opus, faisons un truc plus original, des id√©es¬†?LE VIETNAM !(long silence)‚Ä?Mouais....pourquoi pas.Au premier abord, cela ressemble au premier opus, des d√©cors magnifique et tropical, des am√©ricains,une guerre, bref Far Cry .Eh ben, oui et non, certes, les d√©cors se ressembleront probablement, mais pas l'√©quipement, et l'√©poque.Beaucoup de nouveaut√©¬†: les h√©licopt√®re, les mitraillette (il en avait peu durant la second guerre mondial, c'√©tait plus des fusil a l'√©poque, et ouais :P), le napalm, Rambo, les pi√©ge (du coter Vietnamien), et ¬´¬†tutto il resto¬†¬ª (tout le reste).Ce que je n'arrive pas a comprendre, c'est pourquoi les gens demande plus d'arme, je veux dire, le jeu nous propose un nombre de classe diff√©rent avec beaucoup d'armes assez diff√©rente, c'est pas cela qui manque, non, ce qui manque, et m√™me si le workshop fait le taf a la place des d√©veloppeur, c'est les maps, il y en a assez peu, 5 ou 6 a en comptais de t√™te, et ce n'est pas en reproduisant les m√™me pour d'autre mode que sa vas vraiment changer (d'ailleurs, seulement 3 ou 4  se joue avec des h√©licopt√®re).Par contre, ces map sont vraiment, tr√®s tr√®s bien foutue, mais je serais plus int√©resser si ils nous faisait des maps se d√©roulant la nuit, ou sous la pluie, se sera plus int√©ressent a voir. (surtout que le premier opus compter environ 20 cartes a vu de nez!).Sinon,le syst√®me de niveau reste classique, avec de quoi modifier les skin de nos perso, m√™me si il serait fort sympathique si il y avait plus de choix pour les visage, et la possibilit√© de changer la coiffure, car c'est pas une tonne de casque/chapeau qui rajoute du sucre au caf√©.Conclusion et l√©sionMon √©va, et, je pense, simple, mais pr√©cis, il y a beaucoup de chose a dire..mais rien a la fois.Ce jeu, si je en faisait pas une √©va que je teste et refasse une √©va sur la pile qui m'attend, j'aurais probablement passer plus d'heure que la vie le permet, il est franchement tr√®s bon, c'est une petit exp√©rience a tester qui vaut plut√¥t bien son prix8,5/10, j‚Äôattends toujours de pouvoir faire un rambo comme perso.(d√©sol√©e des fautes d‚Äôorthographe)								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/418460,"25 November, 2018",263.1,162.7

On ne l'attendait pas sortit celui l√†, pourtant, il a √©tait annonc√©e, et pour tous les petite personne qui ont flipper devant le premier Outlast, faut avouez qu'il mettait un peu la Hype.Et alors¬†? Apr√®s sa sortie¬†? Apr√®s avoir finie le jeu¬†? Qu'est ce que je pense¬†? Bah.........bof, c'est cool mais...dommage un peu.Am√©no et le saucisson¬†!Tr√®s bien, donc, on se retrouve dans une histoire qui totalement aucun rapport avec le premier jeu, a part au niveaux du gameplay et du titre.Forcement, on retrouve ce qui nous √©viter a mettre des lunette bionique dans le premier, la fameuse cam√©ra a infrarouge, autant dire qu'ils ont am√©lior√©e l'aspect ""night vision"" ils ont d'ailleurs am√©lior√©e les graphisme et notamment la lumi√®re, qui vraiment, fr√©misse a un peu la r√©tine.D'ailleurs, quelque petite nouveaut√© dans le gameplay nous permette de bien mettre dans l'ambiance et de mieux fuir pour mieux flipper, comme par exemple l'utilisation d'un micro ou encore se permettre de s'allonger pour se cacher ou passer des obstacle (offrant d'ailleurs des course poursuite assez stressante).D'autre petit truc sont sympa, mais inutile, comme les bandage (plus ou moins utile) ou les enregistrement, alors c'est sympa, mais faudra qu'on m'explique comment il fait pour enregistrer un dialogue qu'il ne dit et comment il fait pour renommer sans clavier les vid√©o, mais bon, je vais pas faire la fine bouche.B√™tise soit tu.... (Blague bof √©vit√©e)Apr√®s les nouveaut√©, voyons un peu l'ambiance et le sc√©nario eeeeeeeeeettttt.......c'est l√† que sa p√©ch√© un peu je trouve.Alors autant, niveau ambiance, le jeu est tr√®s fort, m√™me si on a l'impression de faire un marathon de cache-cache souvent, alors je veux bien comprendre que le principe et de se cacher et de fuir, c'est normal (d'ailleurs, je vous comprend pas ce qui le reproche que tu ne peux que te cacher, c'est le principe m√™me d'Outlast¬†! Alors m√™me si le personnage et baraquer au testost√©rone de buffle en rut, le but reste de ce cacher !), mais l√†, il y a tr√®s peu de temps consacrer a posez l'ambiance, a se promener en criant au moindre piaf qui vole, et c'est pas les flash-back dans l'√©cole qui font passer la pilule.Pourtant, il nous offre a certaine passage ou on se promen√©, et la, vraiment, c'est passage l√† sont, nous seulement d'une beaut√© par le d√©cor ou la mise en sc√®ne, mais en plus, vraiment stressant.(on pourra citer le passage au bord et dans le lac ou encore avec la pluie de sang)¬†D'ailleurs, du coup, on loupe plein de truc vraiment cool parce que on a constamment la sensation d'√™tre poursuivie (du coup, je vous conseille vivement de prendre votre temps).Coter histoire, bah, sa rester int√©ressent et myst√©rieux jusqu'√† la fin, l'inspiration sur les √©v√©nement de Jonestown se fait voir, et √ßa colle assez bien, bon, pour les plus jeunes, chercher pas trop, c'est pas tr√®s beau, (mais qu'est ce que vous faite l√† d'ailleurs?).La fin, d'ailleurs, bah......un peu fini a la pisse je trouve, bon je vais pas vous citer tout les probl√®me de al fin, sauf dans ce passage¬†: Comment se fait-il que notre femme soit enceinte jusqu'au yeux en 2 heures¬†? pourquoi a t-elle le ventre encore gros apr√®s la naissance¬†? Comment pouvait-elle conna√Ætre le sexe de l'enfant, avant sa naissance (si vous faite attention au dialogue, elle dit ¬´¬†elle¬†¬ª, alors que, de fa√ßon litt√©raire, elle aurait du dire ¬´¬†il¬†¬ª car un b√©b√©, c'est masculin, du moins selon la langue fran√ßaise), et qui est ce n√©cromorphe au multiple bras qui nous poursuis¬†? Et sinon, b*rdel, le personnage.....je veux dire, m*rde quoi¬†!, je veux bien qu'on le fasse parler¬†! Mais pas pour dire des blague moisie qui feront plut√¥t office de r√©plique narnardesque¬†! Au moins dans le premier, il se taisait, et c'√©tait tr√®s bien¬†!D'ailleurs, ce derniers doit √™tre le fils de Guts dans Berserk et de Ken le survivant, car il survie a des truc, mais c'est impressionnant comment c'est pas possible.Sinon, en terme de mise en sc√®ne, le jeu reste parfait, des transitions entre des passages dans une √©cole la nuit et le monde de Farming Simulator en passent par des √©v√©nement et passage vari√©e sont vraiment tr√®s bien fait et finement travaill√©e.Er*ctum palsambouilleBon, a part cela, on noteras le th√®me vus 100 000 fois de ¬´¬†la petite fille,c'est creepy¬†¬ª, je pense pas que ce soit un manque d'inspiration, √©tant donn√©e qu'ils ont montr√©e qu'il pouvait faire autre chose, mais qu'ils avaient envie de faire √ßa, en fin J'ESPERE que c'est √ßa.....Un petit passage pas forcement visible, nous laisse supposez a un DLC.Et la musique est sympa et rend bien.Conclusion:en somme, un jeu qui r√©alise de fa√ßon g√©nial des mise en sc√®ne et une ambiance malsaine, malgr√© la sur-abondance de course poursuite et des probl√®mes sc√©naristique, pour le prix que nous propose le jeu, je vais quand m√™me me l√¢cher, d'autant que le jeu, en courant comme ferais tous joueur (mais ce que j'ai pas fait) il fait un peu court, donc¬†:5,5/10 si vous n'aimez pas cache-cache et les ¬´¬†viens je vais te faire un massage a coup de pioche¬†!¬†¬ª6,5/10 si c'est votre kif(tant que c'est pas en dessous de 5/10, je recommande)Comme a mon habitude, pardonnez moi si mes erreures d'ortographe vous injecte de l'acide dans les yeux.

The game is incredibly addictive, we have many styles of play, we can enter the opponents wreaking havoc or invisibly eliminate all of them in turn. Machines that were a problem, we can subjugate them and order them to fight on our side, which gives a huge range of possibilities.My opinion:I think that the game is great, addictive from the very first minutes I didn't feel like skipping any dialogues despite knowing the whole game.

This is a game, in my opinion, intended for people who are not bothered by frequent sneaking and often annoying patterns that need to be overcome. Apparently, we are moving not a heroine who becomes a superhero in a crisis, but a girl who is afraid and not always able to defeat her opponent. If anyone wants to see and play this game, I recommend the easiest difficulty level, which should be pleasant in the implementation of the presented story, I'm not a fan of games in which you have to sneak a lot and do many things quietly, so the average difficulty level is for bothersome me. But in conclusion, I recommend it even because of the plot itself and showing the hero as a really fragile girl who does not become invincible after the first events, but shows this helplessness.

The primary reason being it is just too frustrating to play properly! The mechanics of the game (basically everything being equal in power to invasion and war) sound like a good idea, but in practice is results in you ""forgetting"" things like managing your culture and then losing vast amounts of territories because your ""ally"" decided to conquer your territory by cultural means instead of open warfare, and as far as I can see, there is no realistic way to counteract it! especially if your territory is surrounded by multiple other empires.Then you have the outpost system... it... is... so... annoying! To turn them into cities costs little for the first city, but after that balloons to what would take over 40 turns of influence points, meanwhile everyone else is turning their outposts into cities seemingly every turn, once again, this is stupid, you should be able to construct cities far easier for the game to actually be interesting and to allow you to build units as only cities can have an army.I have tried now for almost 4 hours to get an understanding of what this game wants, but just as I think i'm doing well it throws a curve ball like having a random unit attack my city from an empire I have a non aggression pact with, then leaving with no mention of what just happened...

The characters have depth and feel real, the story has few plot holes and is very well written with any sensitive issues handled with respect and realistically, not just ""hillbilly stupid and bad"".My only complaint is the use of the powers. It just feels tacked on and is not really necessary to the plot. I feel the game would have actually been better if it had gone down the realism route and just focused on the twins life problems. It doesn't spoil the game, it's just a distraction from the serious plot points.I wish they had the confidence as a studio to accept its OK to have a slice of life game, it doesn't have to be filled with supernatural elements for the sake of it.Overall considering the price and the story you get, this is worth a play.

But I wouldn't recommend paying anything above $20.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/751440,"16 January, 2021",1.8,1.8

The devs seem to have a strong interest in completing the game and adding branching story lines. So far I would say the game is unique and very interesting even if short at just under 2 hours. Once they get the time and ability to complete the next episodes (I think they want over 10) the game will be worth a full ¬£50 easily.A solid 8/10 from me and the thing is just getting started.

The game requires you to basically build a fully functioning hospital from the start which both removes the feeling of having progress. The design of the hospital is also pretty limited as you have to keep building multiple of the same room types for each department rather than sharing them such as restrooms and waiting rooms. Overall I feel this game could be so much better if it had more of a prison simulator feel to it.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/868360,"9 November, 2019",4.6,2.3

However this is also the con as the majority of the game is based around this mindless violence concept of bullet time, after you've watched this animation for the 50th time the effect gets dull and repetitive and then you start to notice the story, or rather lack of one along with the AI which seems completely stupid and only around to catch the bullets you fire like a live firing range. As other reviewers have said, if you have played the last Sniper elite titles this is no more than an expansion pack on those.The basic premise of this game is a chapter based story mode, you are in random large maps and given seemingly random and repetitive missions, ""blow him up"", ""kill him"", ""blow this thing up"", it gets dull by the third map because their doesn‚Äôt seem to be any point beyond ""see how far away I can kill this Nazi"". This would be ok if you had to use strategy, however the AI is so dumb even on hardest difficulty you loose immersion by how stupid they are.Also day one DLC's are a big no for me for a ¬£40 game (along with showing them in the game as something you think you can unlock through hard play).If I could sum this game up in a few words it would be Hitman but with stupider AI and less kill options, yet that game got ""bad"" ratings and this is ""very good""... shows what marketing can do.
