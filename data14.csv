But the issue is that it isnt its own thing. There is competition that does much better for the similar price tag.I bought this game because of its ""open world"" tag, thinking that it would be similar to gta 5, but in a different setting. Of course I was hoping for the game to have its own unique spin on the open world genre, but what happend really disappointed me. (Just a heads up; this review will have some comparisons between gta 5 and mafia)The game IS open world, but you cant do a whole lot with this world. Instead of having a open world game with a story, this is a story set in the open world, meaning that instead of having a lot to do in the open world, the only thing you actually do is missions. But those arent the main issues I have with the game. In a single mission I encountered TWO bugs, not even 30 minutes into the playthrough. For those wondering, its the second chapter. The game instructs me to sprint, and I see the valley that I decide to run towards. Only to be blocked by some magical wall (??) causing me to lose the mission. No big deal, I restart from last checkpoint and manage to run through the valley. Now Im told to vault over the fence. I do it. I continue to run and now I have to vault onto some crates (??) and now I fall through the world and die.... That all happend in the span of couple of minutes. Right there and then I though of quitting the game, but part of me tought that the odds of this happening are low so I kept on playing.The driving camera feels odd to say the least. The gun gameplay feels ok, but it lacks that oomph. In gta for example the whole screen greys out and zooms in for a short period while showing the little x, which feels awesome. The controls for anything that isnt gun related are weird though.... Why cant I press m1 to smack someone with the bat? Instead I have to spam q for whatever reason.And finally the language. I really love when a character in 1930s says ""stop bustin my balls"". The game isnt bad and I can see why the game has so many positive reviews, but it isnt my cup of tea. I dont think its worth 40‚Ç?especially when gta 5 which costs 50% more offers MUCH more. Not to mention that gta 5 often goes on sale meaning you can get it for even less than 60‚Ç? I would recommend buying this game only if its on sale, and only then.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030840,28-Aug,2.4,2.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1427,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198276338779/recommended/,Other,7,Recommended,0,0,"This game is amazing, however there are a couple of problems I have with it. Overall the game is fun, you can spend a whole day without getting bored because this game is just so much fun. The things I like Ok first lets start with the good parts. Firstly you can play any nation which existed at that time, and even if it didn't, you can tag the country which owned it at that time, and chances are, you can release that nation. Also the default focus tree is amazing. While it doesn't provide anything historicaly related with that nation, it provides the nation with a couple of military factories, civilian factories, infastructure, option to quickly change the ideology, option to develop your airforce and navy, and to get a couple of research bonuses. Also if you have waking the tiger dlc, almost every nation gets the option to form the nation at which they were the biggest (ie. Iran can form the Persian Empire). Also even tough good portion of nations don't have the custom focus tree, by every dlc, new focus trees for nations get added, and old custom focus trees which have some flaws get reworked. What I really like is how you can pick many alternative routes. Wanna go trotskiyist soviet union? No problem. Want to make america communist while you play fascist britain? No problem, just pick in game rules for america to go communist route or go non historical. One thing I also really like is the achievements. Some of them sound funny, but the reason I love them is because how hard some of them are, and it makes you feel amazing when you get them, and sort of it tells other how good you are. I also love things such as resistance which make hoi4 realistic, however there are some problems which I will mention below with it. I love the research system and I love how you can't research everything instantly, making you decide what do you want. Do you want a strong army and airforce or strong navy and airforce or strong army and navy? It is up to you to decide. While it is restricting, for people searching for a challenge it makes it more fun, and in multiplayer games it makes it more balanced and it requires more teaming. And finally, the thing I absolutely adore is how easy it is to get the mods and how many mods there are, which can variate form a small colour change, to a change in whole timeline or era. Also the music is amazing, most of them are relaxing. Those are all the things I like about hoi4, now it's time to talk about couple of problems.  The things I don't like One thing I don't like about hoi4 are the Soviets. They aren't hard or realistic. Germany can without a strugle DESTROY the Soviets. While The Great Purge debuff is amazing, there are really small buffs later on, which doesn't presure Germany into declaring the war in 1941. or earlier. The only strong thing about the Soviets are their manpower and the Stalin line. As soon as you go trough the Stalin line, the game for the Soviets is pretty much over. Other thing which makes me dislike hoi4 a bit is the power of airforce. It is too powerful. You can literally make 1000 planes and make them kamikaze strike english channel or make them naval bomb and you DESTROY the royal navy. And while there are ways to counter that, it takes a giant effort to get rid of this problem if you don't have a good airforce. Now I already mentioned how I don't like something about resistance. That something is that you don't get that people uprise against you, the worst thing that can happen to you if you don't take care about resistance is to lose factories in that region. The last thing I don't like is about a dlc.  Death or dishonor  . You can buy it if you want or not, and that is why I won't complain how little it changes, but the things I don't like is that Yugoslavia doesn't have partizan uprizing.Those were all the things I liked and hated about hoi4. Of course I absolutely love this game, but it wouldn't be a proper review if I didn't include some minor things which sometimes irritate me.  DLCs  Together for Victory A really amazing dlc, adds a better puppet managment and focus trees for the british colonies and a better focus tree + Britain itself. Overall it is really amazing and you get a good protion for its price Death or Dishonor This dlc adds the least content and actually just adds focus trees for Yugoslavia, Romania and Hungary. The price is questionable, if you come from any of these countries I guess that it is worth it??? Waking the Tiger This dlc is worth its price. It reworks chinese overlords focus trees, and Japan. Also adds the option to form nations like I mentioned in the ""the things I like"" section. It also adds the better unit managment (force attack, last stand....). Personaly one of my favourite dlcs. Man the Guns The most recent dlc which adds most stuff into it. Personaly I like some things, and some I don't (like USA being op af with infinite oil) but overall I like it. I did read some reviews and some don't like it, some do so yeah, in the end it is up to you weather or not you want to buy a certain dlc or not. Conclusion I would of course give this game 10/10There are a lot of things you can do in hoi4, and whenever a new dlc comes out, pretty much the whole meta changes because of how much stuff they add, and that is what I love. Dlc are also amazing and if you really love this game and want to buy them, you should.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/394360,"7 April, 2019",478.2,281.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I love how this game doesn't just focus on land, but you must focus on navy too, and if you don't, then you're screwed. I also like how every troop has its own unique ability, which can either be used to make your unit stronger, making it vonerable for a shorter period of time, or just as a last chance for your unit to survive/defend your base. I love how mcv can go into water, which gives you a chance to actually survive if the enemy dominates the land. The plot is nice, and just like in ra it shows the corruption among the soviets. I recommend this game to everyone who loves strategy games, because it just offers so much. I also like the ""research tree"" and how it works. I love how I can get some special ability without building anything, and how I gain experiance over time.Now the part which I don't like. To me, naval gameplay feels forced, because it is in every mission, and good amount of missions you can't actually make vehnicles made for land only because at the start you are on the island. Exept that I don't have any other problems, and I know that this problem may be contradictory because I said how I love that you must build navy, which is true, but I don't like being forced to build my navy absolutely every mission I play.

If you're a sandbox fan and you love challenging yourself, then this is the best game, which will complete those two requirements. Even tho many people at first think this game is like minecraft, it isn't, and btw stop thinking that any sandbox which looks blockish is a minecraft, because it isn't, and this game is a perfect example of it. At first, for beginers and people which have entered in hardmode, they may find this game overwelming, but once you complete this game first time, you will pretty much know the whole game. PRETTY MUCH. There are so many items, each run can be completed differently. Sometimes you may complete this game multiple times, and then later discover a new item. Even tho at first. since is a 2d game, players may think that that is a limitation in certain ways, but I can tell you now, devs have manished to completly remove that 2d limitation. Game is fun and full of items, just like mentioned before, but there are also biomes, from which every single biome has its respective mobs. Bosses are fun and exciting, and even tho you have to beat some bosses to progress (otherwise you can't complete the game), it doesn't really feel like it. You can summon the boss yourself, or randomly encounter it. Not every boss is a must fight. Almost every prehardmode boss can be bypasses, and you can instantly kill a boss which puts you into so called ""hardmode"". For those who are interested what hardmode is, it is just like a new start of the game, but harder, and no, that doesn't mean that your items get deleted or world, you keep the items, but there are more mobs and more biomes, and also most importantly, new bosses and items. For sandbox fans this will be amazing game, as they can explore, build, fight and craft. So I recommend you to buy this game, because you will have so much fun in it. Personaly I am not a big sandbox fan, I would much rather prefer fps or rts games, but this game has so much to offer, that I absolutly love it. Now the other part of the review, a bad part. Game is just like I said overwelming for new players or players which are first time in hardmode. When I was first time playing terraria I had terraria wiki open 24/7 to know how to craft stuff or how to obtain certain items, but again, like I said, once you complete terraria first time, you will know how to complete it second time. I recommend you to watch youtubers or streamers play it to learn a bit more and being on terraria wiki, and even try creating few worlds so that you find a perfect one for the first time, that way you wont have problems obtaining items required to defeat the bosses, that doesn't mean that you should get one item, then hop to your main world, make one more world, get items there and repeat this process, no. That means that you should make one world in which you will easily find items and caves, and make that your main world, and play ONLY on it with one character. Another problems is how long it takes to obtain certain items, lets say terra blade, since I am tired of explaining, just click  here [terraria.gamepedia.com]. And even tho it is true that is takes forever to obtain lets say, terra blade, they made it really rewarding. Now since I did defend bad sides you may say that I am being ""fanboyish"" towards terraria, and I will be honest, that may be true. But that is because I love this game, and I hope that many good updates will come out in the future. Terraria rating: 10/10Edit: Also to mention, in terraria forums, there are a LOT of mods you can have fun with once you have beaten the game, or even before, and community is really nice.

That is my opinion in short, so if you have just wanted to know my opinion in short, here you go, now time for full explanation what do I like and what I don't like I like how in this cnc game we went from 2d technology to 3d technology, and it really gives this game some beautiful and stunning graphics. What I don't like is that you have removed almost every building and vehnicle and character from older cnc games, and yes I do understand that there weren't any vehnicles or characters or buildings from cnc 1 that could have been made by you (except if you used mods) in cnc 2, but cnc 2 had a lot of easter eggs which are reffering to cnc 1 + when you're battling against mutants, you see them use older vehnicles from cnc 1, and also in the last mission on gdi side, if you're quick enought, you can also get to use tanks from cnc 1, also there were a lot of missions where buildings from cnc 1 were in hidden places, but ok, lets get back to cnc 3. There weren't a lot of easter eggs, but what I do like is new side, scrin. It really explains some stuff about tiberium and its exsistance on planet earth. Another thing I am not big fan of is the effectivity of weapons. It just feels like that you have to make at least 20 vehnicles (from which 10 are at least anti soliders and other 10 anti buildings/vehnicles), while in older games you could just build one same vehnicle or troop 10-20 times and you would complete the mission, but I still like that you have to mix vehnicles and not just spam, lets say titans in cnc 2. I like the game it is really well made and I would recommend it to everyone. Also I like that you can turn buildings and turn your view. Sadly servers are now dead so I couldn't have had fun exploring techniques while meeting different people. This game is probably togheter with ra3 one of the last good remains of cnc franchise, since newest released cnc game, looks nothing like classic cnc games. Westwood had some really amazing and creative ideas for cnc 3, but since ea had them, their ideas didn't even mean something to ea, so they fired them, and you can really see that this game looks like half westwood product because there are some ideas which definently look like from cnc franchise and yet there are some thing in this game which don't look at all like older cnc games. And cnc 4 was just a proof that ea run of westwoods ideas.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/24790,"27 December, 2017",20.9,7.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Personaly I had around 10 guns and with every gun I had so much fun! Game offers so many things you can do, that you simply want to come back to the game again :D I am playing cs:go, but sometimes I just come back to the skill, that was also my first fps and that is why I love it! Also the sound effects are awesome! Headshot sound is epic in my opinion :) I also like how they allow you to exploit some of the guns (sniper rifles in this case) where you can quickly reload and then not even look at the scope (but you clicked the button for the scope) and then instantly shoots and I love how that makes your aim better :D Also every gun has something special about it (famas and a great damage, p90 and scope, awp and fast movement speed and good aim). The only thing I don't like is that every spray costs and that I can't work hard for it to get it, but I must spend the money to get it.

Game is fun, it isn't that one game with cool graphics and bad content, it has ok graphics which even low spec computers can handle  and still the game is really fun and really well known.However, even tho the game is great, like every game, even cs:go has some bad sides. First of all ranking system. Elo system may be precise and good in big ranks, but in silver it is unbalanced. You can see 3 players in your team having 15-17 kills and then 2 of your team mates with less than 10 kills. Second of all, competitive is too stresful. I am writing this by my own expiriance, and even tho some people are not stresed, I am one of those people which are stresed when they play cs:go.Now back to the good sides. Most of the weapons are balanced, and even tho terrorists have weapon advantage over ct's, ct's have advantage over points, they are controling them.In the conclusion, I love the game,  and I can't wait to see future updates of this game!

It also reminds me of the Warcraft 3 map ""Ant colony"" which offers similar gameplay.  The game is entertaining and does have enough levels to justify the price in my opinion. However, I dislike that there is no way to obtain food in the ""Formicarium"" which lead to having to replay story levels to farm enough food to be able to finish the challenges (which must be beaten in order to continue the story missions). I feel as the development of the ant colony is a bit shallow as well, you just get some food storage and then start massing units. It would be nice with some additions like some sort of defense and research structures. It's also a shame that free play can't be played with friends.

The biggest issue is the lack of strategy, I feel no accomplishment at all after winning a battle. There's not really anything in the game that wants me to keep playing it.Here are some problems about the game:- Barely any description about units- Spell book is just a big mess and it's hard to understand which spell is valuable to use since description isn't that detailed and you can only cast a few spells before your mana runs out. - Not balanced at all between factions- Difficulty to control units during battle- In beginning of the game high level monsters are guarding resources which won't allow you to progress until you have some units, so basically you are stuck doing nothing- Battles are really boring and later into the game they take ages, the battle itself is just a big mess and you barely have much control over the battle, hence not much tactics can be used- Hero feels really useless, he runs in and dies immediately- AI turns takes quite long time to make their turns								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1656780,1-Mar,1.7,1.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Why? Well, because they didn't abandon the game (yet) and I think I bought this game 2013 which is a rather long time ago, but I would dare to say the game has come quite far since I first played it. Still in its current state there is enough content to entertain you for quite some time. I had a blast playing this with my siblings on split screen! The game can be very punishing and difficult, luckily there are many customizable options regarding game settings which can adjust the games realism/difficulty to the players liking.

But underneath it is an intense psychological thriller in the manner of the TV series Fargo. There is some good voice acting and even better eye acting. The puzzles range from easy to quite tricky. Mostly they are in the form of logic problems. You might need a pen and paper to work some of them out. It's appears to be set in Canada or somewhere up in the frozen north anyway. Good.

Fix the Floor Puzzle Glitch (I believe it occurs after leaving the puzzle room and returning to it)2. Many animation glitches Certain NPC's have items/ weapons flying during Dialog3. When switching party members from the camp it would be nice if they didn't spawn at the start of a dungeon you are halve way done because having to wait for a NPC to walk up to you through most of the dungeon after you just talked to him face to face at the camp is weird its like you stop at the door and go wait here until we get back to where we were and then walk to us : )4. Character creation is very good i love it but there is sadly a lack of faces for you to pick more would be nice.5. Please add bard class ;-;6.More of the standard D&D races for players would be great (dragon born, half orc would be great)7. Fix texture load time's please 8. Make it so you can't pickpocket shop owners its a bit over poweredand thats everything i can be bothered to write lol But i can't wait for this game to fully release I'm sure it would be amazing and remember children don't feed the owl bears (unless they are pets or ask nicely)								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1086940,"22 January, 2021",65.9,16.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Qued for like 10 min but didn't get into a match.)-unbalanced Matchmaking (A lot of times you get qued against people who are way better than you and you have no chance of winning.)All in all a good game, especially considering the fact that it's free.If you like games like quake and CoD and want to see them mixed with portal this is the game for you.7/10, would recommend.

It's the best ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?game ever!but let's get the cons over with: 1) The game is rather dead, but we can always hope, it makes a glorious return.2) A game takes forever! A game takes atleast 35 minnutes, unless you die early-game, which isn't really better.3) The ranking system is completely ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•... If you're a player who just joined the game, and therefor is rank 1500, you will most likely meet people of 1900+ in your first match, and it dosn't get any easier, cuz people of high rank can just join a low rank match like it was nothing.4) The first 50 hours, will probably not be incredably fun, since you have to understand the mechanics, and learn to outsmart other players(which feels awesome, if you do it right btw.). I do recommend you play ARK: Survival Evolved, before even touching this game.5) You will be killed in a 100 different ways, before you understand, to watch your back.6) Once you die, you're out. This is the best thing about SOTF(Survival of the Fittest), and the worst, since this is annoying when you get killed, but it gives a freaking rush when you kill someone.Finally! the Pros:1) The rush you get from eliminating/killing another player is amazing!2) The game itself might be rather dead, but the community is still very much alive. If you try unofficial, you'll find tons of cool people, with a lot of wierd settings/gamemodes.3) Once you die, you're out. This is the best thing about SOTF(Survival of the Fittest), and the worst, since this is annoying when you get killed, but it gives a freaking rush when you kill someone.(This is the same, as number 6 of the cons.)4) You have so many possibilities! You can either go for guns, like longneck rifle(classic sniper) simple pistol and simple shotgun, or you could gather some berries/meat and some tranquilizer arrows and go tame creatures like rex, spino, bronto, argentavis, sabertooths, raptors and more! you can also mix crafting with taming and make a combo like an argentavis, a sword and a shield, and then just jump your enemies from the air! or make some c4, and put on a little dodo, and send it to it's death with a huge explosion!I don't know what else to say, but let me know, what you think about the game in the comments! :D								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/407530,"7 July, 2017",301.5,292,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Choose between five classes, two of which are unlockable and start exploring various locales, such as caves, forests and catacombs. At first, you may be discouraged by the presence of permadeath and instadeath, in the form of spike and boulder traps, but as you progress, your senses will co-ordinate to help you avoid them more easily. There is so much to do in this game, especially as you level up; you can learn new affinities to make you stronger, more dextrous or enable you to perform various class exclusive tricks, such as enchanting, becoming stealthy, receiving holy protection etc. Or just use your wits and combine that poison potion you found with your sword to cause poison damage, or that bomb with an arrow to become Rambo. The fighting and platforming feels great! Defeating the stage boss fills your entire level bar and also feels very rewarding. SInce you can level up only once per stage at the campfire after finishing it, you may choose between being stealthy or just rush to the level boss or just ignore it and gather experience from killing regular enemies. It may seem weird, but personally I like this mechanic, since it adds to diversity and can be used by some playstyles. All in all, Vagante is a hard but wonderfull game with great replayability, that should not be missed. Thumbs up!

The latter come in two forms: First, it's the curse system, which can be manipulated to an extent and help you, since most curses are give and take, but beware of the final curse that can destroy you easily. Secondly, the evade/parry maneuver. Evading is relatively easy but costs stamina, which is something you need to watch out for constantly. Parrying is harder, needs precise timing, but if you manage to do it, you will weaken and expose enemies for massive damage. Some strategic decisions, like choosing the most helpful item to buy, the currency to use (gold or blood) or the path to follow in the map, will also play a significant role in your adventure.

Wolltest du schon immer wissen wie viele 12 J√§hrige es schon mit deiner Mutter getrieben haben? Willkommen bei CS:GO! Hier lernst du Russisch innerhalb weniger Wochen und kannst die Top 100 Beleidigungen in jeder Sprache. Innerhalb weniger Spiele kann man mehr Beleidigungen auf russisch als in der Muttersprache. Wer glaubt mit Englisch in diesem Spiel etwas zu rei√üen, der irrt sich gewaltig. Konflikte werden durch Teamkills gel√∂st und sollte das nicht reichen, kommt noch ein ""Nazi, ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô? hinterher. Sollte man im ersten Viertel des MM im R√ºckstand liegen", verl√§sst auch schon der erste Teammate das Spiel.Ok, jetzt mal ernsthaft.Mit fast 400h Spielzeit habe ich schon so einiges in diesem Spiel erlebt und etwas Erfahrung," wie ein Standard Matchmaking abl√§uft.Teams:Wenn dann auch das letzte lustige Wesen in der letzten Sekunde """"Accept"""" dr√ºckt werden die Teams gew√§hlt. Diese sehen dann meist so aus:1. Du2. Russe 13. Russe 24. Russe 35. RussenkindSobald dann einer """"Cy*a"""" im Voice-Chat gesagt hat", falls dieser √ºberhaupt benutzt wird," wei√ü man schon """"another fu*king russian in our team..."""" Da dies ein Teambasiertes Spiel ist", sehen die Osteurop√§er nat√ºrlich ein, dass Englisch ein No-Go ist. Somit kann man den Voice Chat dann schonmal deaktiviern. Mit etwas Gl√ºck hat man auch mal einen kompetenten Spieler im Team, aber sonst hei√üt es: W√∂rterbuch bereit halten.Gameplay:Da das Spiel ja sehr realistisch ist, (ich bin auch im Afghanistan Einsatz und sterbe durch eine Decoy, easy!) muss nat√ºrlich auch das Gameplay dem entsprechend aufgebaut sein. Zwar ist die RPG nicht als Waffe erh√§ltlich, jedoch √ºbernimmt jede andere Waffe diesen Job mit Bravour. Wenn man hinter seinem Gegner steht und sein ganzes Magazin verschie√üt, weil kein einziger Schuss getroffen hat und sich dann einen Millimeter bewegt hat, begr√º√üt dieser einen mit einer 180¬∞ MLG Drehung die er noch im Sprung durchf√ºhrt hat. Was passiert? Du kriegst derma√üenein in die Fresse das du dann einfach in der Ecke chillst und ggf. geht deine Tastatur, Maus, Headset oder auch dein Monitor kaputt. Dann gibt es ja noch die AWP. Wenn man mit dieser Waffe umgehen kann, die t√∂dlichste Waffe die man in der Hand halten kann. Jedoch kann es kaum einer und trotzdem holt sich jeder diese Waffe. Wieso? Um sie dann wieder zu verlieren weil kein einziger Schuss getroffen hat.Rangsystem:Wer denkt, dass dank dem Rangsystem nur mit gleichwertigen gespielt wird, der irrt sich auch hier gewaltig. Denn noch viele Wochen nach einem CS:GO Sale wimmelt es nur so von Hackern und von Smurfs will ich erst gar nicht reden.Dann kommt noch dieses Prime Matchmaking, ein sinnloser Knopf der auch hier seine funktionen erf√ºllt...Skins:Skins sind der Schl√ºssel zum Erfolg. Wer denkt das er mit Versch√∂nerungen besser ist der kann direkt durch die T√ºr gehen und Call of Duty spielen. Hat man keine Skins bist du arm, ein Hacker oder ein Smurf. Hat man Skins, bist du ein 12 J√§hriges Gl√ºckskind das durch 3 Kisten 500‚Ç?gemacht hat und damit wie ein Opfer angibt. Hat man ein Messer ist man der K√∂nig vom Staubhaufen. Um Skins zu erwerben gibt es auch hier wieder zwei Optionen:1. Kauf dir die paar Pixel f√ºr unglaubliche Summen √ºber den Markt2. Kauf dir Schl√ºssel, F√úR 2,30‚Ç?ODER MEHR, und √∂ffne Kisten, wo in 80% der F√§lle ein Gewinn von -98% festzustellen ist.3. Nutze die Kreditkarte deiner Eltern - die werden sich freuen.Fazit:Wer das Spiel spielt, um Spa√ü zu haben, der kann hier mit nichts falsch machen. Wer aber auch spielt, um im Wettkampf zu gewinnen, sollte sich bevor er spielt eine volle Lobby mit Freunden suchen, bevor er das Spiel startet.Wenn ihr keine lust habt und wollt auf einem h√∂heren Niveau spielen dann meldet euch bei ESEA oder bei FaceIt an. Eine gute alternative um den Hackern aus dem Weg zu gehen (ACHTUNG! Da spielen auch Profis die es, ja... Wirklich k√∂nnen...)Denkt immer daran: CS:GO ist wie Roulette," lustig bis es russisch wird.								""",https://steamcommunity.com/app/730,"6 August, 2016",994,540.8

I think the factions are balanced very nicely while still maintaining distinction and fun factor on all sides. My only gripe is that the AI pathfinding for when you ask a troop to move is a little buggy, larger mechs like to get stuck on things and infantry like to move when you dont want them to after engaging in combat depending on their range or sometimes just not doing anything while being shot if their range is too small. Its a small issue if you do a lot of micro managing when you play RTS games which I do. Back to the faction balancing. For example the exo infantry class, the polanians have a ranged exo with a shield ability that is great for pushing entrenched MGs with some squishier infantry behind it, while the Rusviets exo are a melee class but with an ability to jet into combat from a certain range that is fantastic for taking out any anti mech infantry behind enemy mechs when in a heated firefight. Obviously most classes are the same such as the machine gunners and the anti mech infantry squad but  I have yet to see any mechs on any factions that are remotely similar in their effectiveness. Polanians excel in hit and run tactics, flanking, and taking entrenched positions from multiple different angles, with their high mobility mechs, shield exos and scouts. On the other hand the rusviets excel in taking positions by force, anchoring positions hard and locking down the map, with flame, artillery, and heavy anti armor mechs as well as the close ranged base infantry and bunkers.The story pulled me in and has twists and turns, breezed missions and tough ones all together a very good campaign and I found myself pushing through the hardest missions just to see what happened next in the story. I fell in love with the characters and story which was a pleasant surprise for an RTS since usually I just get annoyed with the characters saying those little quips when you click on them. Overall I would give the game a 8/10 if the pathfinding and AI was a little better I think this game would be perfect to have enemies actually fighting from entrenched positions and pushing up slowly rather than bum rushing your defenses and getting stuck on all the razor wire.

I've been using an Intel i7 6700K, a GTX 1070, and 16GB of RAM.Don't get me wrong, I understand this is a terrible PC port, but 5 years later, the hardware should at least run the game at 60 FPS in 1080p. Also, play the game on a controller and not keyboard and mouse because of the breaking of mouse sensitivity depending on your framerate.But about the game, the combat system is a HUGE improvement from the first game, such as having more options to take down vehicles, and having to equip two mutated weapons instead of picking one using an equip wheel.The story is the cliched family revenge story. But, it's interesting to see a different dirrection tone and focus even though it's not done very well. It's roughly a short 18 hour campaign along with all of the upgrades, side quests, etc.Side missions are also very repettitive, involving the same mission structure every time, but at least they're quick and can be done in less than a couple of minutes per objective.Overall, If you wanna give it a try, I would say go ahead. It's a good game with it's own flaws. just be aware that the game is unoptiumized and the developer of the game ""Radical Entertainment"" shut down 5 years ago so you can always find community patches and do some research to fix it. A good game, just a terrible port for some users.One more thing: Don't buy this game at full price. Wait until one of the BIG Steam sales to get it 75% off.

But I will say this, it's a very affecting one. The game follows three men in Delta Force out in a post-apocalyptic Dubai to rescue civilians, but things go south very fast. The story begins to question you almost like this ""Are you really a hero?"" The game is directly based on the novel Heart of Darkness (Joseph Conrad), which gives the force to get it's messages on heroism across in effective and powerful ways. One of the chatacters is even a nod to the author of the book. I say to give it a try for the single player experience. The multiplayer is just tacked on and unless your willing to screw around with your friends in a private lobby, it's dead. Also, the gameplay mechanics are just good old run, aim, and cover shooter mechanics. If your okay with this, then this is disturbing, sometimes beautifully constructed story, using it's Dubai setting to create a hellish atmoshpere that builds with tension and fear.

But, that doesn't take away from the breathtaking open world of Panau.  Story wise is pretty much like the last game and is very forgettable, ""Overthrow a corrupt Government by causing chaos in the region"".  The main character ""Rico"" is a very generic action hero badass who is pretty much the equivilance of every 1980s action hero that creates the character.  I felt like the lack of character development and story is done on purpose because really, it's not all that important.  The reason however why most of the substance flaws are made up is because of how much effort Avalance Studious took their time to make the beautiful world as well as the masterfully executed gameplay mechanics this game has to offer including the infamous ""grappling hook"".  Overall, the story is not important but I recommend this game for the open world exploration, action, and many features of mass chaos.By the way if you don't already know, there is a bug that if you complete the full game of Just Cause 2, it will say 99.99%.  If this happens don't worry because this is only a minor bug and the developers are not supporting the game anymore because of Just Cause 3. Also, this game doesn't have mulitplayer, but there's a mod that someone created and is avalible on steam right now.

It is a little hard for you to jump onto objects if you don't do it right, but you can still get used to it, and isn't a game changing issue. I ended up stopping playing the game since my controller broke, and made operating the machinery very difficult (for me) to play and advance. Other than that, this is a very good game, a very detailed simulator (one of the best I've seen out there), and i would highly recommend this to anyone.

Mais vale tirar j√° este calhau do caminho... Os gr√°ficos s√£o meh. Um jogo lan√ßado em 2018 com gr√°ficos piores que o seu antecessor e que tem reflexo em tudo para ""parecer bonito"". At√© pensei que estivesse a embelezar as mem√≥rias do pouco que tinha jogado do jogo anterior, mas n√£o...Supostamente levou recentemente um update para melhorar os gr√°ficos, mas... N√£o teve muito efeito? Um pouco irrelevante porque ao fim do dia os gr√°ficos neste jogo continuam sem ser nada de especial.O som √© outra anedota! Talvez seja s√≥ eu, mas acho o som dos carros muito abafado. Talvez seja por jogar outros jogos onde o som de facto √© bom (Dirt Rally por exemplo) mas senti que o som era muito fraco. Mas depois com os sons dos ""pops"" do escape a parecem sa√≠dos de algum meme.... ENFIM! Como √© que algu√©m aprovou lan√ßar um jogo assim.E pronto... vamos √† parte talvez mais triste de todas... a condu√ß√£o.Os carros parecem verdadeiros planetas, d√£o a sensa√ß√£o de terem uma densidade superior √† do Ouro que depois √© auxiliado por ter pneus com super-cola :)A s√©rio, o jogo come√ßou e ao fim da primeira curva j√° tinha ficado enojado com a f√≠sica de condu√ß√£o.Mas pronto, este jogo n√£o s√£o s√≥ carros, n√£o √© verdade? O que me leva ao seguinte ponto:Jogo de carros que n√£o √© jogo de carros? Lembro-me de ver o trailer do The Crew original, com todas as modifica√ß√µes e todo o mundo aberto que o jogo iria ter, e ... uau, que espet√°culo de jogo que era na altura pelo trailer. A verdade √© que acho que o jogo at√© ficou qualquer coisa, ao contr√°rio deste...N√£o fa√ßo ideia qual era o objetivo de estar a misturar carros com barcos e avi√µes... Alguma esp√©cie de prova de triatletismo...?N√£o tenho nada contra quem goste do conceito, mas eu (que gosto tanto de carros como avi√µes, apenas n√£o tenho muito interesse em barcos) achei o conceito um pouco parvo. N√£o gostei, confesso.A quest√£o √© que a √∫nica coisa que o jogo parece ter a favor (porque n√£o vou estar a jogar para confirmar) √© ter algum tipo de hist√≥ria associada? Dar algum contexto e (tentar?) motivar o jogador a progredir, por√©m... N√£o sei, fui algu√©m que cresceu a jogar Gran Turismo, um jogo onde se joga pelo prazer que o jogo nos d√°, n√£o √© preciso ter uma hist√≥ria para nos fazer continuar a jogar...Lamento se parece que s√≥ tenho coisas m√°s a dizer do jogo, mas... infelizmente √© a realidade. Por norma nem costumo dar m√°s avalia√ß√µes a jogos (muito menos a algo que jogue em F2P weekend), mas senti que este jgoo foi uma perda de tempo aut√™ntica para mim e depois de verificar que o jogo tem aproximadamente 80% de reviews positivas... fico um pouco incr√©dulo devo confessar...Dito isto, para quem n√£o se importar de largar 10‚Ç?(na promo√ß√£o atual, ou 50‚Ç?fora de promo√ß√£o) por um jogo com 4 anos que √© pior que o anterior e cuja condu√ß√£o √© rid√≠cula....

1548,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198121005312/recommended/,Other,9,Recommended,0,0,"O Wargame Red Dragon √© sem d√∫vida um jogo que ganhou um lugar no meu cora√ß√£o.Descobri este jogo assim duma forma muito aleat√≥ria, vi mais sobre o jogo e adorei, esperei por uma promo√ß√£o e comprei!Com coisa de 20-30h no jogo este j√° se tinha tornado dos meus jogos favoritos, merecendo um lugar no meu top 5.[Singleplayer]: Para quem gosta de jogar sozinho existem 2 modos: O modo ""campanha"" e skirmish. O modo skirmish √© id√™ntico ao modo online, por√©m jogado contra bots inv√©s de jogadores. Por outro lado o modo campanha tem mec√¢nicas interessantes e tamb√©m alguns... ""defeitos"".O principal problema no modo campanha no Red Dragon √© que a IA (o bot contra quem jogam) tem ... ""t√°ticas"" ... de batoteiro :)Ao contr√°rio dos jogos anteriores (Airland battle e European Escalation), que a IA era mais polida, no Red Dragon a IA tende a enviar unidades baratas em barda e atacar diretamente as unidades de comando. Em adi√ß√£o, a IA tamb√©m n√£o respeita os limites de pontos, basicamente conseguindo comprar muitas mais coisas que o jogador a determinadas alturas, pelo que por vezes o modo campanha se torna um pouco trai√ßoeiro e frustrante.Dito isto, √© sem d√∫vida divertido, e dependendo das campanhas que se joga existe sem d√∫vida a possibilidade de repetir a mesma campanha e jogar de maneiras bem diferentes concluindo os mesmos objetivos. As campanhas t√™m diferentes finais (3 para ser exato), 2 deles no caso de vit√≥ria e um no caso de derrota. Enquanto no Wargame Airland Battle os pontos que o jogador obt√©m servem para obter diversos ""itens"" que t√™m impacto na batalha e na informa√ß√£o que o jogador tem, no Red Dragon os pontos servem para comprar grupos de unidades para utilizar durante a campanha. No fim do dia os 2 jogos apresentam uma campanha diferente dado que no RD (Red Dragon) v√°rios grupos de unidades combatem em simult√¢neo no mesmo setor numa s√≥ batalha, enquanto no ALB (Airland Battle) n√£o √© bem assim. Alinhado com o facto de nos 2 jogos as unidades terem custos diferentes entre outras coisas, muitos consideram que o ALB tem uma campanha superior ao RD, por√©m eu diria que depende do gosto de cada um. A grande vantagem do ALB √© que o modo campanha pode ser jogado em cooperativo.[Multiplayer]: A parte em que o Red Dragon realmente brilha!Especialmente quando comparado com os anteriores Wargame, este destaca-se pela positiva. O jogo √© muito mais polido do ponto de vista do online, mais equilibrado em v√°rios aspetos e feitios. Existem 3 modos de jogo principais sendo eles ""Conquista"", ""Destrui√ß√£o"" e ""Economia"". Economia √© a ovelha negra uma vez que praticamente ningu√©m joga, visto ser um modo... um tanto estranho. Destrui√ß√£o √© sem d√∫vida um modo interessante para quem come√ßa no jogo, e tende a ser a atra√ß√£o para os novatos, por√©m conquista √© o modo eleito pelos jogadores mais experienciados. Enquanto o modo destrui√ß√£o tende a ter um jogo por vezes parado e que acaba a ser os jogadores das duas equipas parados nos mesmos s√≠tios a tentar destruir unidades inimigas de alto valor (cuja pontua√ß√£o √© mais alta), no modo de conquista as coisas s√£o bem diferentes...  Por vezes um jogador pode acabar com um K/D mais baixo do que o perdedor e ter estado na lideran√ßa durante todo o jogo. Isto deve-se ao facto de no modo conquista os pontos que cada equipa ganha se dever estar associado √† quantidade de zonas capturadas por cada equipa, e o peso de cada uma. Se ambas as equipas tiverem uma zona +1 capturadas, e uma das equipas capturar tamb√©m uma zona +2, ent√£o essa mesma equipa come√ßaram a ganhar 2 pontos por cada ""tick"" do jogo. No final a equipa com mais pontos (ou que atingir o objetivo de pontos, ex. 500 pontos) ganha, exceto nos casos em que a diferen√ßa de pontos n√£o exceda o necess√°rio para uma das equipas ter uma vit√≥ria, pelo que assim terminar√° com um empate. [Deck Building]: Basicamente o que torna o Wargame diferente de tantos outros jogos do estilo RTS, a possibilidade de escolher as unidades que se levam para o campo.√â poss√≠vel escolher entre BLUFOR e REDFOR (o cl√°ssico, n√£o √© verdade?), sendo ainda poss√≠vel escolher dentro das mesmas, diferentes na√ß√µes e alian√ßas. √â ainda poss√≠vel escolher especializa√ß√µes, como por exemplo ""Motorizado"" ou ""Mecanizado"", ou at√© mesmo data limite para as unidades (por exemplo, unidades anteriores a 1980). Todas estas op√ß√µes resultam numa varia√ß√£o de pontos para a cria√ß√£o dos ditos ""Decks"" que depois s√£o usados pelo jogador nas batalhas (contra outros jogadores, ou skirmish). Esta √© uma parte importante do jogo uma vez que n√£o s√≥ d√° um certo sabor de costumiza√ß√£o ao jogo como tamb√©m permite o jogador ter um estilo mais pr√≥prio durante o combate, o que consequentemente o torna t√£o diferente de outras op√ß√µes que existem no mercado e ganha o dito espa√ßo no cora√ß√£o dos jogadores que gostam tanto dele. Com isto a an√°lise chega ao fim. O jogo obviamente tem v√°rias mec√¢nicas e afins que seriam demasiado extensos para cobrir numa s√≥ an√°lise, e existe v√°rio material no youtube para tal efeito. Dito isto, uma nota importante a deixar √© que se forem jogar o multiplayer contra outros jogadores devem ter em aten√ß√£o as ""premades"". Existem v√°rios jogadores que simplesmente gostam de jogar contra novatos para se sentirem melhores com eles mesmos (porque contra bons jogadores n√£o se safam...) e portanto recomenda-se que tentem jogar com jogadores do vosso n√≠vel. Deste modo, dentro dos lobbies, cliquem nos jogadores e vejam os perfis, observando o √≠ndice de vit√≥rias e a quantidade de jogos jogados.E pronto, fica aqui conclu√≠da a an√°lise.Qualquer d√∫vida podem sempre deixar um coment√°rio.Obrigado pelo vosso tempo e bons jogos ;)								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/251060,"27 November, 2021",630.1,565.5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Evito comprar DLCs est√©ticos, mas acabei por comprar um ou outro para uma marca ou duas, por√©m o DLC das cabines e afins foi por utilidade, pois alguns cami√µes n√£o t√™m GPS de origem, e acreditem que este d√° bastante jeito para quem gosta de jogar num modo mais realistaClaro que j√° gastei mais infelizmente, e cada vez fazem mais DLCs que tanto podem ser cosm√©ticos como realmente importantes para o jogo, que permitam novas regi√µes e novos tipos de cami√µes e mercadorias. Infelizmente parece que os pre√ßos cada vez sobem mais, e √† quantidade de DLCs que fazem torna-se imposs√≠vel acompanhar o ritmo. Para quem se quiser divertir apenas de vez em quando, mesmo sem DLCs o jogo √© bastante bom, mas cuidado para n√£o cairem no buraco negro dos DLCs, este √© um daqueles jogos perigosos que vos pode limpar a carteira!

Neste jogo o tr√¢nsito √© o vosso pior pesadelo, o vosso pior inimigo, o vosso maior obst√°culo face ao progresso, ou o que lhe querem chamar...√© me igual :)A verdade √© que desde inicio voces t√™m que fazer j√° planos em acabar com o que fizeram, por exemplo, uma pequena cidade com 50 casas no futuro se n√£o a expandirem ir√° ter 20 ou nenhuma porque precisam de fazer uma linha de comboio (pouco provavel) ou de comboios (same here) mas provavelmente uma autoestrada para terem ""todos os caminhos v√£o dar a roma"" ou seja terem 1001 formas de entrarem na vossa cidade, n√£o no ""pa√≠s"" mas nas cidades que v√£o fazendo, n√£o o total repito mas sim na zona urbana x ou yBom acho que o review est√° feito e continua√ß√£o dum Bom Dia, Tarde ou Noite!Atualiza√ß√£o para 2020:Ignorando alguns coment√°rios anteriormente feitos, venho dar uma pequena (detalhada) atualiza√ß√£o para os interessados.Joguei-o novamente, recentemente, e existem algumas coisas a anotar:O pre√ßo do jogo baixou, mas come√ßaram a surgir mais e mais DLCs, cada vez a pre√ßos mais altos (que o jogo). O jogo continua a ser jog√°vel sem os mesmos, e em √∫ltimo caso podendo-se recorrer a mods.Com os mods vieram obviamente atualiza√ß√µes para o jogo (com novidades para todos os jogadores, mesmo sem os DLCs), e uma das que merece destaque √© a ""Mass Transit"".Apesar de na teoria esta atualiza√ß√£o resolver em grande parte os problemas de tr√¢nsito no jogo, fica aqui a opini√£o de quem s√≥ soube que teria sido ""arranjado"" depois de ter jogado e lembrado da chatice que era o tr√¢nsito no jogo. CONTINUA A MESMA COISA!Sim, at√© acredito que possa ter melhorado um pouco, mas numa estrada com v√°rias faixas os ve√≠culos continuam a optar pelo caminho mais curto. No fundo √© extremamente prov√°vel numa estrada com 5 faixas os carros se empilharem apenas numa.Contudo, o DLC trouxe algumas op√ß√µes para tentar melhorar e gerir melhor as estradas para os interessados. Existem mais DLCs, tamb√©m eles interessantes, mas creio que este seja dos mais importantes a n√≠vel de produtividade.

Tho this cannot be removed unless they wanna rework hard or removed miku entirely and i see no point in that.A few bugs that i have noticed is that some achievements wont pop, i have cleared all normal songs with grade SSS, but the achievement 'Complete all normal difficulty stages with grade SSS' isnt unlocked. and i have every achievement for every song with grade SSS. This isnt the only achievement, its a few more aswell, hopefully they will fix :)Other than this i think the game is very fun to play, recommended!^ Old review ^V Updated review VThe achievements i complained about in the old review seems like it has gotten fixed.

1571,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198148881414/recommended/,Other,6,Recommended,0,1,"This game is actually quite amazing. Not only does it come with a survival game but a horror game mixed in with it like when it becomes night, literally your screen turns black, and then you gotta pray some dude with a AK47 with a flashlight doesn't just demolishes you and your pants while you're running home with a inventory full of loot but that's got me wondering why is that. I know damn well if I didn't have any loot on me I still would've met the same fate so why would he do that ?The game is actually a nice comment about the distrust that human beings have when it comes to our own individual survival, but the culture it has formed around mercilessly slaughtering each other without a second guess is also quite interesting. It's probably a natural psychological reaction towards our own survival that everybody is capable of hurting me and I should be careful of everybody but then it becomes soured by the very moment we spawn on that beach since we probably got either killed by a fully geared AK guy or some naked with a rock and this instilled the belief that you must trust NO ONE.It's an interesting chain reaction of violence that is actually quite real in reality and should be understood as a possible out come of using violence to achieve ones means either through hatred or discrimination. The interesting thing about all this is that no one really cares or understands how immoral all this is (but it's reallly just videogame and haha pixels die)But if the human brain is capable of such violence towards one another through the lens of anonymity and a culture of hatred,caution or spite we humans can become some of the most feral beasts.Let's put a hypothetical idea in your mind, Imagine if in 2203 the Earth is this regressed civilisation with no modern day appliances.You are born in this world and see that people are sparse and few but you met one, a complete stranger, You talk to him and he responds with some funny comment or some nice greetings and you begin to like this individual.You then go and talk about building a house together so that you may survive and become stronger together. He happily agrees and you manage to build a house, He then asks if you want to check something in a box and before you know it, He stabs you in the back with a spear and as you lay their he doesn't make a sound doesn't bat an eye simply looking at you lying on the ground, at his mercy, filled with anger, sadness, despair and betrayal you simply die there and find you are brought back to life on some beach.Now what would any rational person think after experiencing all those emotions and no pay off no revenge. You would never trust a person again. Killing everybody who would harm you as a way to prevent those emotions from spurring up inside again. So you look around and see a man wake up on the beach near you. You then go up to him and kill him, all the while he has to wonder in confusion, anger and sadness why would you do something like this. And then he wonders if he shouldn't trust anybody anymore.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/252490,25-Apr,591.1,543.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It has- Just the right length.- A great plot twisting, captivating story.- Great writing with good voice acting.- Fun and interesting gameplay mechanics (deductions, card collection, choices, etc)- Interesting character- A great ''noir like'' style- and overall really interesting design.On the other hand, there are many graphical issue like- Pretty poor depth of field, that most often than not put subjets out of focus. (I suggest you to turn the option off in the settings)- Element that are hidden from view behind object somehow create some kind of blur on what's in front.- Controls are not great. Movement is impaire way to often when close to wall and objects. It can be hard to navigate sometimes, and interacting with objects sometimes need specific placement that can be cumbersome.In the end, the small issues I have encountered, are exceeded, BY FAR, by all of the positives in that excellent game!

Having to press the joystick down to move forward really is weird and counter-intuitive. It will be fine for people who like to teleport, but those who enjoy smooth motion are stuck with pretty bad controls. For the rest. the control overall worked great.

I bought this to play in VR. First, it cannot be played with the VR controllers. It does require The mouse and keyboard or controller. Meaning that I had to keep having to put on/remove my headset to try and position myself, go back in the VR setting, changes my gardian boundries, but then, the ''position'' you need to be in is really small. If you are out of that physical space, you cant see anything other than a wireframe model showing you where to position yourself. I tried to recalibrate with the VR buttons but it wouldnt work. I had to physically move over and over and somehow, the position kept going further and further.Basically, this game was not made properly for VR.

How is coreless toilet tissue manufactured you ask? Well let me tell you! Directly from the US Patent US8535780B2 for coreless toilet tissue:In general, the present disclosure is directed to a coreless tissue product and to a process for producing the product. The coreless rolls of the present disclosure, in one embodiment, are made from a spirally wound tissue sheet that defines a hollow passageway through the center of the roll. The passageway is lined only by the tissue sheet itself. The passageway can be substantially circular. As used herein, the phrase ‚Äúsubstantially circular‚Ä?means that the circumference of the passageway is free of any cornered or roundness constrictions and is free of any inwardly bulged portions. In one embodiment, for instance, the circumference of the passageway can have a radius that varies by no more than about 25%, such as no more than about 20%, such as no more than about 15%, such as no more than about 10%.Of particular advantage, the passageway can be formed in the spirally wound roll without using a core and without using an adhesive that adheres the inner layers together. In the past, for instance, various types of adhesives, such as starch adhesives, were used to form hollow passageways without the use of a core. Unfortunately, however, the adhesive rendered the end of the roll unusable. Thus, even though a core was not used to form the product, waste was still produced. The present disclosure has found a way to solve the above problem...Please look up the patent listed above for the rest of the process								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1475810,16-Jun,13.7,13.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

All the environments are beautifully drawn and never are boring to look at. That in itself is an achievement for a game with four sections and endless replay value.Gameplay-wise, it's a roguelike with an in-depth story, a feat that Hades pulls off with style to spare. This game sends the player, Zagreus, son of Hades, battling through the planes of the Greek underworld with the help of the Olympian Gods in an effort to escape. Along the way, you get blessings and boons from the various gods that determine your playstyle. None of these blessings or boons are without their place, and when enhanced in the right ways enough could easily play a defining role in how each run goes. As the game progresses, more weapons, boons, powers, and perks become available to you, and you will never have identical runs. The Gods themselves are as you'd expect them, a big, bickering family that has many differing views from one another, and questions everything the other does. Their one uniting factor? Getting you out of the Underworld and to their mountain home of Olympus... Or so they think. Meanwhile, your father's goal is to stop that from happening.It is an absolute joy to watch all of the bonds Zagreus forges throughout the game grow to bloom, and it makes dying, normally punished by titles in this genre, actually rewarding in its own way. It effectively takes the sting off of a failed run, and usually kicks off the next, in a neverending loop of ""Just one more run..."" From the Fury Megaera to the hero Achilles, and even Hades, God of the Underworld himself, the interactions that Zagreus has with these characters have lasting effects in the game's story. I've completed 8 runs so far out of 39 (a lot of those runs were early on, didn't get my first full clear until around 17 runs), and each one has introduced a playstyle completely new to me. One run I've got a spear with a supercharged dashing strike that does over 300 damage per hit and hits 3 times per use, the next I've got a greatsword with 40% of my total health but get 2 life back per hit, dashing with a Zeus powerup that jolts enemies to their ends. Every build runs by your choices, and can easily be redefined and reshaped to suit your needs.All in all, this game will keep me coming back for a long time still. Hades is a masterpiece, and the sort of game that sets a very high bar for an entire genre.

There's a lot of depth to this game that, even on the second mission, you're looking at how best to approach each group of enemies. This only gets amplified with each character you add to your roster.One example of this, Cooper can do stealth takedowns at a range by throwing his knife, while Doc can throw his bag out to be seen on an enemy's patrol pattern to lure them in. Once they open that bag, it blinds them, and Doc can ambush. When you mix these two options, you need to weigh which one is better to use where, or if it'd be better to use in tandem with the other. If there's an enemy wearing a pancho, they will not go for Doc's bag, so it's better to use Cooper to take them out. Putting this in action, I used Doc's bag as a distraction for one enemy to pull his patrol pattern away from a Pancho that I had Cooper kill while the patrolling guy was distracted by the bag. When he got blinded, Doc stealth killed him.This game has many ways to approach each group of enemies. Stealth is the main focus so far, but is pretty satisfying to do. You could also just ignore a lot of them if you move right, and then there's going loud, which you'll find there's a time and place for.All in all, the game is beyond what I expected of it so far after picking it up for the sole reason of it being reviewed as overwhelmingly positive on here, and I absolutely look forward to whatever comes next.

The amount of options the game presents you to resolve conflict is astounding. The combat system is a constant dance of damage, dodge, parry, stun, and fury attack, and it feels great in use, yet as I said, I have had a lot of fun finding ways around combat as opposed to launching into it as is common in so many other games. Be it sneaking through a warehouse undetected both in and out, talking your way out of a problem, or using some sort of trickery to distract, there's a lot of different approaches to the game. It also feels like there are a lot of small buds in the story that bloom into larger consequences, though I have yet to reach said consequences. It is rare that I find a game that keeps me wanting to see what the next quest has in store.The perk trees are interesting, you get a point for one of the three at different levels.It feels a bit slow at first but does pick up when you're put on the Island to explore the world they've made.Graphics-wise, I've encountered only a couple bugs that were easily fixed so far, such as the lower part of the chest armor losing its texture (and fixing it by changing gear off and back on). The dialogue looks a bit rigid for how detailed faces are, but unlike some other RPGs, it's not terrible.That being said, some things that bother me are:1) The dialogue doesn't always match the subtitles, which have plenty of typos.2) In the start, your character is getting a portrait painted. It starts as the male character with a voice line  before the character creation. This felt a bit odd, since right after this, you have the option to choose to play a dude or a lady.3) Playing as a female protagonist, you get referred to as ""he"" sometimes in less important dialogue.These are not too big of deals and can easily be overlooked, but they do feel a bit inconstistent. That being said, I wholeheartedly recommend this game to anyone looking to scratch that itch for a new RPG world to immerse themselves in.EDIT:I KNEW it felt familiar! Spiders made the Technomancer. While I haven't finished that game, I did enjoy the time I spent on it. They've really come a long way since that game, I'd say it'd be worth keeping an eye on any Spiders game that comes out, they're really growing in skill.

Id knocked the combat, enemies, and gunplay out of the park. The enemy factions all feel unique, Mutants (Muties) are your ""hordes pouring out the walls to overwhelm you"" kind of enemy, a task they actually do really well in the early game. Goon Squads are the bandits of the game, and you can tell Id had fun making them, their actions are bombastic, from striking strange poses when shooting to hitting a grenade with a baseball bat (which you can interrupt while the grenade is up to do some real damage). There's also the Shrouded, basically they are the more militaristic faction, with armor to match, they're so far my favorite to fight, since there's so many ways you can go about dealing with their armor. Other than that, the Authority is the techie bunch, they look all funky but they aren't too difficult.Weapons. Every weapon you get stays useful. Even the pistol. You will gravitate towards some more than others, but you never feel like another, less used weapon is completely useless. Each gun feels unique and has their own perks, really boosting how you want to play.Perks, this is where things get a bit out of hand. I didn't discover most of the perk trees until I was 6 hours in and finally decided to drop by a main story objective I was passing by, but oh boy, do they affect a lot of the game. You go from a fresh ranger to essentially godhood pretty quick, though that might just be because of how many points I had saved up throughout my time elsewhere. However, this isn't without a bit of pessimism.Bethesda.net.Contrary to what the note says on the Steam page, the game does not actually require a Bethesda.net account, but what binding one to your Steam account does to the game is why this is a negative.Bethesda added a cash shop to the pause menu. Thankfully, not the pause you use most of the time in the game, and the cash shop requires a Bethesda.net account to use, so it's completely optional.As I understand it, Avalanche developed the world. I don't know how, but they somehow created a world that's somehow both full of activity and completely barren of it at the same time. The worldspace has many areas with base objectives, and has skirmishes everywhere in between. Chances are, while you're looting an area you will hear a ton of explosions going off in the background... And you just won't care about it. There's no reason to engage in these skirmishes. Driving between areas, you'll see a Goon Squad or a pack of Muties at most every turn, and normally you just keep going, to the next area where you can truly wreak havoc. Imagine if each of Doom 2016's levels was a location on an open world map, that's basically what Rage 2 does.I'm not a fan of how dialogue is run in the game, you retain full control of your character while the NPC is just... Talking. Occasionally your character will respond, but there were multiple times where I straight up ignored contacts while running around in circles just waiting for something to happen.The larger locales are fun and interesting to explore most of the time, but eventually you end up running through each area again and again until you find that one last crate (there's a perk for that). Now for the meh part of this... Vehicles. Really, there's not much to it, you get one you can upgrade and a bunch that you can also summon at will including a hovercraft that lets you fly about the map...But let's go back to that one you can upgrade for a second. This tank of a car has machine guns, rockets, a radial pulse, you name it. It even has a voice companion akin to an 80's action movie supercar, but it has just this one problem...It.Does.Not.Shut.Up.This should be one of the first things they patch post-launch, the voice is constantly droning in that car, it ruins how much you can enjoy it. Unfortunately, it is in the one vehicle you upgrade. Otherwise, the vehicular combat is OK at best. It's decent, but it kind of feels generic at this point, with similar systems in games like Borderlands. It just doesn't do what the ground combat does.So why was this review a thumbs up, you ask?Because the combat is truly amazing and really carries the rest of the game. I don't regret buying the game at full price because of it, and while I do wish the map was more interesting, I'm having a ball wreaking havoc around the Wastes. Id really did a fantastic job in making an entertaining combat system that, if you want a Doom-esque open world game to fool around in for a few hours at a time, this is a great candidate.

Peer to peer connections instead of a dedicated server? This is 2017, Ubisoft, a AAA competitive title should have DEDICATED SERVERS to prevent hosters from leaving, ending the session. That said, just finding a game half the time is a pain. You'll wait for a minute and just have it say, ""Session is full. Try again."" or ""Unknown error, try again.""Another thing, for a AAA title that just got released, it is VERY difficult to find players around your skill level, even though the matchmaking system (which, by the by, you can't do any customizations while searching for a match) has a line regarding player skill. Oftentimes, you'll get that line to say no limit, meaning you either obliterate the enemy or get utterly steamrolled. This also affects bot matches, of which the difficulty cannot be set by an option, which makes the bots go from 1 (easy) to 10 (godlike future-sight hellbeasts), but no control is given to the player to set it themselves as it is.As I said, the game is great. The combat is great. The gameplay is great. The matchmaking and hosting are absolute trash. That is what ruins the game. I don't doubt that this might just eventually get fixed to be bearable.

This is a game which takes many queues from McMillen's previous titles, but turns them into it's own beast. A story containing elements from Time ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, gameplay similar (BUT NOT IDENTICAL) to SMB, and kickass music inspired by classical pieces. I liked all the parts here, and was excited for the game prerelease. So then, why have I only played it recently, and only about halfway? To put it simply: other games. I really hate to say it, but TEIN is a relic of game design past, the platforming is not as precise as, say, Celeste. The story is almost non-existent, or at the very least intentionally vague in traditional McMillen fashion: lacking a satisfying payoff for the sometimes insane levels of difficulty pushed through. As expected from a McMillen game however: the art direction is top notch, with every level/chapter having a very distinct mood.Celeste comparisons are rife due to the release windows only being 6 months apart, but I think they're fair comparisons to make. Celeste is a masterclass in platforming, music, art design, story even! Most anybody who's played Celeste (if you somehow haven't do it now) will agree with me about these points. As a near-lifelong fan of McMillen games, it pains me to say Celeste is just a better game.So, why is this review positive? It must seem like I dislike this game so far based off of everything I've said but I truly don't. It's more than a little rough around the edges, and certain mechanics could've used more thought to flesh out. A great example of this is the interconnected world design, TEIN is laid out like one big level with sprawling screens in every direction, something which visually is pulled off flawlessly with smooth transitions. I don't hate this idea, but in practice it generally ends up just being annoying. Having to run through an entire chapter simply to grab a tumor in the last screen is incredibly annoying, this can usually be solved by going to the next chapter and clearing levels backwards, which sadly isn't always possible. Despite all these shortcomings, this is a game which is very easy to lose hours in. Booting it up I would often find myself facing down a clock upon realizing just how long I had been playing. I enjoyed my time with this game, but feel no desire to replay it, and don't believe it will be remembered in the same vein as McMillen's other games. It's also really f***ing hard, something I try not to let influence my review or opinion, but it has to be said somewhere just so the reader is aware.TL;DR: Very hard game, feels slightly unpolished compared to McMillen's other work, but is a fun time nonetheless and very much worth your money in terms of content present. Just be ready for minor annoyances here and there.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/583470,"18 July, 2021",12,12,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There isn't much I can say that you haven't already read in the other reviews, but I was having such a good time learning to P-rank every level I felt compelled to write my thoughts. Once you get ""into a groove"" with the movement mechanics the game truly comes alive, flying around every arena popping heads with the marksman revolver (or any of the unique weapons) is truly incredible fun. This game benefits from the focus of having a singular dev, and no idea feels wasted as result, every arena feels expertly crafted around how strong V1 can be in the right hands, creating new challenges that test your limits around every corner. Don't even get me started on the fantastic secret levels, I won't give any of those away, but know that they're all something special in their own right.Buy this game, follow it's development, be happy.TL;DR: Remarkably Challenging, Incredibly Fun, Fast Paced, Fantastic.

The core gameplay loop is deceptively complex, allowing unexperienced fighters to help/participate in the team battle while still allowing skilled players to capitalise on forethought and correct reads.  64 player gamemodes are always a great deal of fun, with Duel servers being an excellent place to improve your technical skills and experience.   Compared to Mordhau (which this game often is), it is more accessible and comedic.  This promotes a casual and fun-loving experience, where players are more commonly cooperative and flexible as opposed to intense and skill-driven.  The team-based objectives and maps are much more similar to a Fantasy movie mega-siege than a gritty and realistic depiction as in Mordhau. Classes and weapon choices are varied, with all itches being scratched and no playstyle left out.  There is a ""meta"", however every weapon is effective if you spend enough time learning it.  The class system in my opinion is a large contributor to the games more team based gameplay.  Players don't need to specifically choose to add a medkit to their loudout to help the team, instead anyone using a Footsoldier subclass will be forced to have medkits as their ability. Overall I can strongly recommend this game if you are even remotely interested.  If you like the idea of battlefield but with a medieval setting, this game is for you.  All players, whether completely inexperienced or veterans of the franchise are welcome in the community.  Because of the light and casual nature of this game, you should not worry about being ""bad"", as you will surely improve quickly due to the subtle learning curve and have fun regardless of whether you win or lose. -For the Masons!  <3								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1824220,21-Jun,50.8,36.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
1617,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198057368846/recommended/,Other,9,Recommended,18,3,"WARNING:  This review is written for the gameplay and mechanics of the game, NOT the poor optimisation at launch (which is a huge issue).   (TLDR)---The game is currently unrefined and poorly optimised as of release, however the gameplay is still incredibly fun.  Returning the beloved modern shooter setting to battlefield's recently developed approach to gunplay and classes.  HIGHLY RECOMMEND considering that every Battlefield game has started out rocky at first, the gameplay is so fun I can easily overlook the janky framerate and bugs.  ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------(OVERVIEW)---  Battlefield 2042 harmoniously blends the incredibly satisfying gun-play from the previous entries (BF5, BF1) with the modern shooter setting from the classic entries (BF3, BF4, BFBC2) to create an overall enjoyable experience.  There is a large focus on making BF2042 a culmination of all previous games using their custom match creators with other games content, along with the mechanics from later entries.  (GUNPLAY & GAMEPLAY)---  In this game, the system for applying attachments to your weapons has been completely reworked.  Instead of creating your dream gun in the menu screen and being stuck with the specifications the whole match, you can choose between a personally selected few attachments for each slot to freely swap between at any point as a footsoldier.  This opens up the versatility for ALL WEAPONS immensely, allowing you to turn your long range marksman rifle into a suppressed, high fire rate, short range semi auto in the span of roughly 4 seconds.  This ability to adapt your weapons at any moment creates an incredibly fast paced atmosphere in game, where players are no longer forced to sit back just because their gun has a 4x scope.  You essentially get 3 gun loudouts inside of your one gun, this is a huge contributing factor to the overall enjoyment of this game and is being well received by most I have asked.  The class system has also been revisited.  Players still have 4 weapon / gadget loudout slots (Assault, Medic, Engineer, Sniper) for their custom weapon classes, however players can now choose from a roster of operators that each have a passive and active ability.  Your loudout slots can be freely changed between each of your operators, so you can for instance still use snipers on your assault classes and vice versa.  This change is welcome and allows for more individualised player experience, however doesn't encourage teams to work together in terms of role choice.  You are no longer FORCED to heal people just because you want to play a medic gun, or forced to repair vehicles if you want to use an LMG / Shotgun.  This has inadvertently reduced the amount of support roles in matches, leading people to play selfishly.  (MAPS & GRAPHICS)---  Battlefield 2042 looks superb, everything from the dirt under your boots to the unrelenting tornado to your left is soaked in battlefield beauty. Stunning reflections and light, ridiculously sharp shadows and textures allows you to get completely sucked into the gameplay.  The models and attachments of the guns are beautiful also, each having an impactful unique sound, firing mechanism and reload animation.  Explosions, fog, water and even the rain hitting trees leaves you with an open mouth as you're transported to any of the games unique maps...Conquest has only a handful of maps, each being incredibly different from each other but felt mostly underwhelming.  There is an immense amount of verticality to the maps due to the introduction of a wingsuit and more traversal options, which encourages moving from point to point rapidly.  The introduction of the attachment changing system had a major affect on the engagement distances of the maps, often left with large stretches of flat and open ground inbetween large (almost mini maps inside themselves) conquest objectives that players are encouraged to flip flop between constantly using their adaptive arsenal and ON THE FLY vehicle summoning. (OVERVIEW)---    Battlefield 2042 feels fantastic, offering a sometimes overwhelmingly fast paced and adaptable gameplay loop that will either be what you LOVE about this game or what you HATE.  There is much less of a focus on cohesive team operations and cautious advances to objectives, and more of a focus on lightning fast, constantly changing gameplay.  It feels more like a 128 player Titanfall with Battlefields' typical hilarious shenanigans and will definitely have it's moments making you laugh your ass off due to the sheer chaos of 128 players (and it being a battlefield game of course).  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this game, it's a fresh foundational approach to battlefield that does a great job of cementing itself into the next-gen wave of video games.  There is plenty to like, and if you enjoy shooters I can GARUNTEE you will find fun in this game one way or the other.  AS OF RELEASE however, do be wary of the poor performance and unbalance, you can thank EA for that...

But I can assure you, there is something ominously attractive about this game. Not only is it absolutely stunning in terms of visual quality, it also runs incredibly well with mediocre computer hardware. The story (So far) is thrilling, enigmatic and leaves you wanting to delve even deeper into the rich story and excellent cinematography. As for the gameplay, it is described as a ""Walking Simulator"" which is simultaneously accurate and dead wrong. You would be surprised how many factors go into ""just walking from point A to point B"", such as.... How many ladders should I bring (Each taking up valuable cargo space)? Will I need to cross through hostile territory? Will I need to cross rivers or large ravines? If I need to go through hostile territory would it be safer to take one large haul and risk not being able to outrun my enemies or should I take 2 separate deliveries which can allow me to run faster and possibly escape losing all my loot? All these and many many more.The variety of situations you can land yourself in this game are seemingly endless and each decision you make can vastly affect the outcome of your deliveries. This is supported by the games (sometimes overwhelming) incredibly versatile and complex menu systems. Each piece of cargo can be carefully stored in different ways on your body, allowing for maximum efficiency when it comes to carrying large stacks of cargo at once. This also includes the use of vehicles, tools and weapons to take the approach that you want to take. All this and I haven't even mentioned that this game has online elements! There is no direct interaction between players, but instead the game utilises a system that allows for player's ladders, postage boxes, climbing ropes and even BRIDGES to carry across each others worlds. If there is a large river in a particular section of the map that is commonly crossed, you can guarantee that the community has collaborated to aid in the construction of a bridge that can allow players to safely cross. You don't see other peoples creations until you reach a specific building in that sector of the map, so the first time you enter an area you are made to adapt using only the tools in your disposal but once you reach the building, you can make use of the player created objects. This makes for easier trips when you have to go back and forth and really brings a sense of collaboration to the game.Overall, I would highly recommend getting this game. Not only is it amazing from a gameplay perspective, but the story is one hell of a ride that not many other games can give you. This game can be and SHOULD be GOTY with this PC release.

The fact that they did not is a good sign.)Fantastic Visuals.The factory/ship interior mechanics were very fun. They slammed Tetris and Factorio together and somehow managed implement it into a city builder in a way that worked. Balancing your factory interiors so that they had proper power distribution, ample employee access, all while maximizing your space usage was very entertaining. Most of my time was spent doing this.The Cons:The one part of this game that doesn't really make it just yet is the combat/strategy system. It's clunky to say the least.Once you're finally at the stage of the game where you are making ships, you are able to build in the interior of the ship similar to a factory. You can design the interior as you please, putting shields, guns, etc. This part isn't really a con, in fact I highly enjoyed designing my ship. Gave me FTL vibes. After about 20 - 30 minutes of designing your ship to be nice and symmetrical with a perfect fuel-to-power ratio, you can finally launch it. Lets go take it for a spin, you think. So you fly it over to the nearest rinky-dink rebel base nearby and... a turret shot it 5 times and its destroyed. You can't save what you placed as a template of anything, so you will have to design your ship all over again. If you did manage to peel your ship out of there in time to take it back to your shipyard, enjoy waiting for the ship to repair. And I hope for your sake you don't have more than one ship, because controlling more than one ship is a mess. Repairing more than one ship is a mess. Fighting with more than one ship is a mess. Did I mention that the ships can only attack in a 1v1? With the exception of turrets. Turrets can shoot you while you're in a 1v1 with another ship. Did I also mention that when you fight with another ship you are locked in and cant retreat? By the way this whole engagement took place in about 30 seconds. The fleet you spent a long ass time painstakingly designing was defeated by some rebels armed with the space equivalent of a 2004 honda civic because they locked you into an 1v1 while their ground turrets wrecked your ships. Verdict: Very solid foundation. Will likely be a very fun game in the future. Only about 12ish hours worth of content so far. Combat system is a huge mess though.

I finished all three games by the 14th of June as I am posting this. Meaning it took me 11 days to go through the three games. I have 132 hours playing this. 132/24 = 5.5.So I spent equivalent of 5 and a half days on this game within the span of 11 days. 5.5 Days Played - 11 Days Since Purchase = 5.5 Days doing real life things.Therefore If I were to evenly distribute my playtime over those 11 days since purchase, I would have played Mass Effect for an average of 12 hours a day.I am unsure if I have a problem or if this was just a really good series. Probably both.Tldr; I spent 12 hours a day for 11 days playing this series. This is a very good series.

They are now both 4 years old.When we were going through our separation, I found myself lost and miserable. I was self destructive. I got so mad one day from everything spiraling out of my control that I punched some concrete in a moment of overwhelming emotion. That caused me to break my 5th metacarpal in my right hand... my working hand... my games hand.. the hand that I held and carried my children to bed with.. The hand I desperately needed to make sure I could continue to provide.After learning of the severity of my self-inflicted damage, I was borderline suicidal. Keep in mind that just a few months before this, I was the happiest man with no history of depression or anxiety. I have never had fits of rage, or been one to break down and cry, but I was in a low spot that just really buried me from being able to see the light on the other side.Having nothing better to do, I searched for a game I could play, ONE HANDED while I recovered. I somehow stumbled upon this game and read some of the reviews. I decided that it had to be worth a shot... I must admit, I didn't beat the game, or play nearly as long as some of you. In fact, I may have only played this game a day or two.. With that being said, after doing so, I had a new found joy and hope for life. I was able to put behind me the pain and suffering that had been cast over me. I was able to experience other peoples joy and happiness. I was able to see the fruits of my ""labor"". I relaxed for 5 ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?minutes to this music long enough to realize that I was going to be okay.After coming to that realization, I turned the game off, and I went back to work. It hurt my hand like hell but I was motivated. I stopped feeling so damn sorry for myself, and I became the father I needed to be in that moment, not the weak boy I was behaving as.Today, I am close friend with my kids mother. We don't fight, or argue, or say hurtful things to each other. We are parents, and friends.I now have 3 kids. My third child is, wait for it, ALSO 4 YEARS OLD. The woman I am with was going through a very similar situation at the time of my own separation, and we just stumbled in to each others life unexpectedly. We have been in a relationship for a year now, and are very happy together.Moral of the story, you never know what life holds in store for you, and if I would have given up when all the odds were stacked against me, I wouldn't be where I am today. This silly little game helped me realize that.Thank you								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/887830,"26 January, 2021",0.3,0.2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Also, I have not played ROR 1, and I've heard that this game is very similar to that so if you liked the first probably you should get the second. With that said, my biggest issue with this game is pacing, or lack there of. There is never EVER rest time in ROR 2 aside from the few seconds in between levels that it loads. Enemies are constantly spawning, constantly getting stronger, and it feels like you never stop shooting. Along with that, the guns, at least for the commander, feel very weak and never through out the game do they feel legitimately strong or fun to use. Which isn't a big issue, until you realize thats the whole game. The combat loop feels like DOOM in many ways, except even less pacing than that game and also without all the cool aspects that make that a fun power fantasy. The upgrades are cool I guess though, although since its all randomized theres not really a way to ""build you own playstyle,"" unless you already know what each upgrade does (it doesn't tell you until you pick it up) and exclusively use the rare 3 item ""shops,"" that show up.

Why? Well it right off of the bat there is an official CS:GO mode, a ""The Hidden"" mode (like from gmod), a trouble in terrorist town mode, WW2 battles, battle royal, team deathmatch gamemodes and more.But thats not even half of it, it is super moddable and incredibly easy to do so too.It runs on Unreal 4, and anyone can freely make maps for this game. Not only that, you can make custom objects using Unreal's blueprint system.What this means is entire games can be built with Pavlov.You can play call of duty style zombies in this as a result which is one of the most fun gaming experiences ever. All the maps are being remade, and I'm even making a map for that mod as I'm writing this. TTT started as a community mod as well until it became packaged in. There's other sick gamemodes as well. And also this means that in theory literally any game could potentially be made, if your a programmer looking to dip your foot into VR, this is an amazing place to try (whole games have been made in Unreal's blueprint).So yeah, this is a game that is jam packed with amazing content, a sick community that is a blast to play with, and could in theory be any game if someone makes an attempt to code it.

TL:DR Only get if you have fun just messing about. There's no structure to anything, but the combat is great. (good test, could you play garry's mod alone without mods for an hour and have fun? Or could you play Unreal tournament, csgo, tf2 or similar multiplayer games only with bots and all items unlocked from the get go? If you think you could, then you might want to purchase this, otherwise I wouldn't recommend it.) Okay so this game is really good! The combat is SOOOO fun and it gives you so many options.For instance, i was able to pickup someone by the throat, grap their weapon from their hand, and use it to kill them.Or you can basically use the force to pickup objects and use them as shields or throw them at enemies.Or you can use spells to stun your opponent before running up to them and killing them.So then why don't I recommend it?There's no sense of completion in any of it, and along with that there isn't much room for customization in difficulty and how everything is setup.There's no multiplayer or campaign or structured levels. Instead there are currently 4 arenas to pick fromand in them you pick a difficulty ranging from easy to very hard and a wave. That or a few special game types like 1v1sor endless. Also, there's not much available in terms of customization for the waves. You have 2-3 waves for each difficulty. You can't change any health modifiers or customize what enemies come or what weapons they have. So there are a ton of weapons you just won't see from NPCs and have to get from a weapon rack. I really wanted to increase the difficulty a bit but not to the extent of very hard. Like needing to be hit 2-3 times before dying instead of what feels like 10. But I didn't have that choice. It was either I was a tank or I get killed in 1 hit. Although the combat is a blast, it was hard for me to enjoy it because of this unstructuredness to everything. There was no sense of accomplishment because all the weapons, spells, enemies, and options are just available to you. For some people thats completely okay, they're fine with just messing about, which is great and i'm super jealous of that. But its hard for me to feel like its worth playing a game if theres nothing structured to accomplish. So I would recommend they add in some full sets of levels instead of just picking and choosing waves. Along with that, if there was workshop compatibility for those campaigns or custom arenas, that would be really good too. The easiest thing to implement that would help a lot is also more customization and the ability to save your custom waves. That way you can tailor the game to what you want a bit more. Also a multiplayer mode whether that be co-op or vs would be neat as well. I find that multiplayer games fill that gap i was describing earlier just by being multiplayer.

And I would say without a doubt that this is my favorite Far cry game and one of my favorite open world games ever, though every game does have flaws.

The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in ‚Äúadvanced‚Ä?countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in ‚Äúadvanced‚Ä?countries.2. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy.3. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later.4. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can‚Äôt predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society.5. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.

You play as a goat and destroy everything. Also, you can stick your tongue onto everything (including living creatures ( Õ°¬∞ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)). This game is great for everyone who likes GTA but with less logic (none), playing as a goat and just loving to make chaos all around you. On top of that, if you are really bored (like really) you can collect all the achievements (yes I did that, because I was really bored). The dlcs are ridiculously well made, espiacally Waste of Space and the Payday dlc. Theres also one DAY Z like dlc that is also cool and a MMO dlc, that you even get for free if you just get the regular game. I am noticing that I've been writing this review for more than a minute now. What am I doing with my life? I need to find work. I should look for it instead of doing this crap. Can you even say crap here? Whatever, the game is actually really good and fun in the possibly most stupid, weirdest and most ridiculous way. Definitely recommend it.

PROS So to start off with the pros I think the game has lot of potential to become a great game that is fun to play. I like the idea of having a ghost hunting game where your goal is to hunt the ghosts and get em before a specific time and as the ghosts then you can troll the ghost hunters with lots of abilities. As a ghost hunter the weaponry and equipment is quite good for what I can tell at a glance but I cannot go into details on which weapons are too op and which are too bad to use and the same goes for perks. The same goes for the ghosts in this regard but I like the unique abilities both teams have. The maps are decent and need to be learned to become better at finding hiding spots or finding the ghosts which is good. The whole concept and the ways to play are fun and it is enjoyable every time you get someone because of an ability. CONS The match making is my biggest concern here since I'm only level 8 and I've been matched up against players at level 53 and they just completely obliterated me without a sweat and that kills the experience for me personally. I think the game needs a system to balance out players and even just having a simple system that makes some sort of balance would be great to have. The servers are also only on client side and there are no servers to connect to so you are connecting to a host player that might destroy your ping and also how fast stuff is getting executed and that is not a great thing in games that are based on PvP 4v4 style play. Personally I feel like the ghost attacks are quite weak and hard to use and they maybe need a strike attack they can use with a high cooldown that does a small amount of damage. Right now you have to rely on hitting your target by being a prop otherwise you will have to punch them but that makes you vulnerable to attacks and you die pretty easily. I get that the ghosts are the hiders but their defense is quite weak if they wanna play aggressively and strike the hunters.Overall on a scale from 1 to 10 I'll give Midnight Ghost Hunt in it's current state...7 / 10 - üåïüåïüåïüåóüåë								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/915810,14-May,5.3,5,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

My favorite gamemode there is currently in the game is definetly 12v12 which is so fun and random stuff happen all the time, that gamemode kept me entertained for hours. The game is free and the content you get currently for that price is amazing and fun. The other gamemodes are also fun to play but personally I prefer the 12v12. I've played a mix of games and all gamemodes kept me entertained for a long time. CONS The game has not have any new content in form of weapons, maps or vehicles so I feel like the game is at a standstill currently with no new stuff introduced. Many Halo fans has talked about community made gamemodes like infection which would be fun to play after looking it up. I wish the developers would add more content other than customization stuff.Overall on a scale from 1 to 10 I'll give Halo Infinite in it's current state...7 / 10 - üåïüåïüåïüåóüåë								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1240440,14-May,65,33.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first map is the only fun map in the game and the others are just annoying to play. Can't recommend unless you are searching for 1 hour of entertainment and then call it a day!My review on Pacify after playing with friends. PROS The atmosphere is great and terrifying especially in the first map in the game and that is well made. Another great thing are the jumpscares and the whole objective fits the game where you have to escape the monster in order to complete the objectives and getting stuck in a place is also really terrifying when you are getting hunted. CONS Scary the first hour you play it and then it gets annoying and competitive because you try to win the game after that. The first map is the only map in the game that is fun to play and the others can be annoying to play. The other maps make me feel annoyed after the objectives are annoying to complete and that ruins the horror experience alot. The price is decent but I wish more content would be added and changes would be made so there would be more content to enjoy for your money.Overall on a scale from 1 to 10 I'll give Pacify in it's current state...3 / 10 - üåïüåóüåëüåëüåë								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/967050,14-May,1.6,1.6,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

1649,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086936723/recommended/,Other,5,Recommended,0,0,I've not played a lot but have tried it out so this review might update! PROS I think the game is great and I love how the feel is of the houses and also how you use the equipment. The steps for exorcisms are easy to do as it's just placing some exorcism items in the ghost room with no other steps other than just dropping them. I love how easy this is but maybe on a higher difficulty this could change to make it more difficult. The amount of interactions the ghost can do really stuns me since there's almost a new thing i see every hunt that I didn't before which is amazing. The whole system about the ghost being a shadow is awesome as well and the only way to show the ghost model is by guessing (either wrong or correct) and if you're wrong then the ghost gets more aggressive as I've experienced. CONS The cons are there are game breaking bugs right now that can break the game so you have to quit to the main menu since you can't use the radio or pick up equipment. This happens randomly and also sometimes when you start a game. The XP system is weird as I've only recieved 50 XP and that was not even on my 2 completed runs. The controls are not changeable which can be annoying at times since I miss click some of the time.Overall on a scale from 1 to 10 I'll give Obsideo in it's current state... 7 / 10  ,https://steamcommunity.com/app/1708460,"29 August, 2021",15,2.4,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Lords Mobile is a game where smaller people (like me) who are free to play can still thrive and have fun destroying other people. I get that you can't participate in the higher ranking of players where they are pay to win only but you can still do lots of stuff in the smaller leagues as well.

Le jeu est sympas avec un syst√®me de qu√™tes journali√®res (bounty), si vous aimez les MOBA 2D comme Awesomenauts, ce jeu est fait pour vous! Il apporte un certain vent de fra√Æcheur et sait se d√©marquer des autres jeux du type!Battlecrew peut para√Ætre exigeant dans certains modes de jeu mais il est en r√©alit√© facile √† prendre en main (clavier-souris/manette). Le seul b√©mol est que pour l‚Äôinstant seul 4 personnages sont disponible, mais le jeu est en early acces et d‚Äôautres personnages sont pr√©vus donc pas d‚Äôaffolement! Je recommande vivement!Edit (17/02/2019):Je souhaitais revenir sur le jeu 2 ans apr√®s ma critique initiale. Il faut dire que mon avis dessus √† chang√© drastiquement.Le jeu √† perdu l‚Äôenti√®ret√© de sa communaut√© en l‚Äôespace de quelques mois. La raison? Une mauvaise comm‚Ä?et des choix marketing douteux. En effet, le jeu √©tait au d√©part payant durant l‚Äôearly access, mais √† sa sortie officielle il se transforme en free2play, ou plut√¥t en free2pay. L‚Äôimpl√©mentation de microtransactions dans un jeu encore en d√©veloppement est de tr√®s mauvais gout. De plus, ceux ayant achet√© le jeu au pr√©alable ce sont retrouv√©s avec un F2P qui te propose d‚Äôacheter des skins dans le store‚Ä?√áa la fout mal! Mais encore, on pourrait passer outre ce probl√®me car le plus gros √† mon avis est la comm‚Ä?qui √† compl√®tement foir√©. Je me souviens que le community manager chez Dontnod Eleven √©tait vraiment quelqu‚Äôun de sympa et √† l‚Äô√©coute des joueurs. D√®s que l‚Äôon avait un probl√®me avec le jeu, il s‚Äôen occupait! Le probl√®me viendrait de plus haut dans la hi√©rarchie, sachant que le studio (anciennement Hesaw) venait tout juste d‚Äô√™tre rachet√© par Dontnod, le d√©veloppement se posait d‚Äôoffice sur des bases fragiles. Le jeu n‚Äôa pas su se faire connaitre, le bouche √† oreilles n‚Äôaura pas suffit car le nombre de joueurs actifs se comptaient sur les doigts de la main.La difficult√© du jeu √† se former une communaut√© √† men√© √† un autre probl√®me majeur; les restrictions budg√©taires. C‚Äôest sans doute ce qui explique le passage si brutal au format F2P, qui aura fait parler de lui en mal avec son syst√®me de tokens offrant un nombre de parties limit√© au joueurs non premium (qui fut vite r√©volu vu son impopularit√©). Il faut dire aussi que le nombre de persos (seulement 4) et de modes de jeux (2 uniquement) rendent le jeu peut attractif, en 2-3 parties on en avait fait le tour. On nous a promis de nouveaux personnages jouables mais nous en avons jamais eu. D√©sormais, les serveurs sont comparables √† une ville fant√¥me et le jeu semble avoir √©t√© abandonn√© par les d√©veloppeur (la derni√®re m√†j datant de juillet 2018)‚Ä¶C‚Äô√©tait un jeu prometteur auquel il ne manquait qu‚Äôune communaut√© active, car globalement il √©tait plut√¥t bon. C‚Äôest ce pourquoi je vous d√©conseille de jouer √† Battlecrew, √† moins d‚Äôavoir plusieurs amis sous la main. En esp√©rant que le jeu soit ressuscit√© un jour, bien que ce soit mal parti.

Ces quelques joueurs qui tuent n'importe qui, peu importe leur position dans la map. Ils sont les rois incontest√©s, et on ne peut absolument rien y faire. On a m√™me pas la possibilit√© de voter pour demander l'exclusion d'un joueur. Ce qui fait que dans le chat de jeu, l'on parle et nomme les tricheurs, mais on ne peut vraiment rien y faire.

Retour sur cet excellent Cyberpunk qui est largement sous-c√¥t√© :https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2130741992La description est plus qu'honn√™te : vous livrez des colis, tel est votre m√©tier, et vous n'allez devenir une super h√©roine en cours de jeu du fait d'un destin particuliers. Peu importe la situation, votre job reste le m√™me. Et bizarrement, c'est g√©nial !En tant que curateur, l'on voit beaucoup de jeux qui s'approprient le style "" voxel "". Bien souvent, c'est bien, mais l'on voit surtout que c'est une technique pour √©conomiser du temps afin de ne pas avoir √† faire des mod√©lisations et des designs en 3D. Dans ce jeu, c'est juste merveilleux : le voxel est tellement bien utilis√© que l'on pourrait croire que le studio ION LANDS l'aurait invent√© ! Avec un d√©tails parfait, des formes g√©om√©triques irr√©prochables et une colorisation id√©ale. Il est important que mentionner un aspect important : une traduction fran√ßaise int√©grale d'une qualit√© exceptionnelle pour un jeu ind√©pendant. Quand l'on pense aux fautes de fran√ßais que l'on peut trouver dans les jeux AAA, c'est quand m√™me bluffant ! Franchement, c'est important de le mentionner.Entre conduite et marche, l'on assiste √† tr√®s bon dosage, qui est assez rare ! L'IA de circulation des vaisseaux et les axes sont mieux g√©r√©s que la plupart des IA des jeux AAA de la d√©cennie. Il peuvent m√™me vous faire des appels de phares si vous faites un √©cart ou si vous risquez de taper dedans. Apr√®s avoir parcouru les autoroutes am√©nag√©es dans le ciel avec votre petit vaisseaux, vous arrivez sur une grande plateforme ou vous devez d'abord localiser le parking. Vient alors un petit jeu de plateforme tr√®s simple et tr√®s beau qui vous permet d'avoir une belle vue panoramique d'une ville qui dort jamais. Sous la pluie √©videmment, car cyberpunk √©videmment !https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2134176213Je crois que c'est le premier jeu qui me donne la sensation de circuler dans les rues du film Blade Runner de 1981. Avouons-le, je pense aussi beaucoup √† Ghost In The Cell, bien que la comparaison s'arr√™te l√† puisque le sc√©nario de ce jeu est bien plus int√©ressant que celui du film de 2017. Le studio ION √©tant Berlinois, il est aussi int√©ressant de penser au film Mute, beau cyberpunk tout autant sous-c√¥t√© ou l'action se d√©roule dans un Berlin futuriste. Ce jeu est √† traiter comme une oeuvre ou l'on d√©cortique une soci√©t√© qui a sombr√© dans le libertarianisme √† l'extr√™me, √† un point que l'on ne peut m√™me plus faire la diff√©rence entre un humain et un andro√Øde, et que certains robots poss√®dent des gratte-ciels tandis que des humains en sont r√©duit √† manger des "" Pizz-Asticot "". Peu importe ce que c'est, si des gens sont pr√™t √† donner une certaine somme pour acqu√©rir cette chose, alors il est totalement l√©gitime de leur vendre cette chose. Ainsi l'on se retrouve dans une soci√©t√© compl√®tement in√©galitaire et totalement d√©pendante de la loi du march√©.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2134462602Il faut aimer lire, ce jeu est un livre ouvert avec une ambiance musicale et un style de jeu stimulant, mais sans plus. De ce que j'ai fait, il y'a pas de courses ni de d√©fis, il faut simplement faire attention √† sa conduite afin de ne pas se ruiner en r√©paration m√©canique. Il faut aussi faire des choix entre le bien commun et le profit individuel. Ces choix-l√† n'ont pas ou peu d'influence sur votre trame principale, mais ils r√©sument ce que vous √™tes, un humain et les complexit√©s qui vont avec.

Il suffit d'une petite heure pour ma√Ætriser les √©l√©ments de gameplay et faire votre chemin.A savoir que le style de jeu "" Tactique en temps r√©el "" n'est pas mon genre de jeu en g√©n√©ral. N√©anmoins, c'est s√©duisant, et l'on accroche assez vite. La beaut√© et la richesse du d√©cors permet une grande immersion. De plus, l'on aide beaucoup le joueur avec un tutoriel pr√©sent & inscrit sur les d√©cors du jeu, au moment ou l'on doit faire ces actions. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2132432723A ce stade, si je me permets de formuler une petite d√©ception, c'est que l'on ne r√©compense pas vraiment le joueur qui favorise l'infiltration. Evidemment, c'est comme √ßa que l'on survie, mais l'on ne gagne pas vraiment de points suppl√©mentaires √† "" √©pargner des vies "" de bandits. Au contraire, j'ai refait la fin de certaines missions afin de remplir les d√©fis qui demandaient un tel nombre de mort avec tel arme ou objet.Au cours du sc√©nario, il est impos√© de faire la mission avec un partenaire qui vous propose ses comp√©tences sp√©ciales. Certaines comp√©tences sont tr√®s utiles, d'autres un peu moins. Par exemple, je n'ai pas compris cette histoire du sac de docteur qui aveugle l'ennemi mais pas vraiment ( ? ) puisqu'il vous saute vite √† la gorge si vous tuez son compagnon pr√©sent dans son champs de vision. G√©rer son infiltration en fonction du champs de vision des ennemis, c'est tr√®s int√©ressant et cela nous donne envie de nous casser la t√™te pour trouver le meilleur chemin possible. Le moindre petit passage peut √©ventuellement √™tre un casse t√™te, et √ßa n'est pas si mal !A ce stade, je recommande le jeu pour son ambiance sonore, musicale et son gameplay int√©ressant. Il faut cependant se creuser les m√©ninges des fois, et il est bien de faire quelques pauses afin de ne pas se d√©go√ªter du jeu. Evidemment, il y'a toujours une fa√ßon plus ou moins discr√®te pour vous permettre d'achever vos ennemis et cloturer les niveaux.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2132488970Les petites critiques que je pourrais lui reprocher ? La st√©rilit√© √©vidente du sc√©nario. Le style western, je le con√ßois, est tr√®s difficile √† porter sur un sc√©nario. C'est √©videmment un peu "" John Wayne "" et donc franchement poussi√©reux, voir us√© jusqu'√† l'os. Et malheureusement, avec la trame de ce jeu, l'on ne sort pas vraiment des sentiers. Seule chose que l'on peut pr√©ciser car c'est appr√©ciable, c'est le fait de r√©partir une certaine notion de parit√© dans les gangs de bandits. Il y'a m√™me pas mal de cow-girl qui incarnent des boss.Jusqu'ici, l'histoire, le sc√©nario ainsi que les petites phrases balanc√©es "" comme √ßa "" sont les seuls points faibles ( qui me semble important ), que je pourrais reprocher au jeu.Une d√©mo est disponible gratuitement via Steam, je vous invite √† vous faire votre propre id√©e.

Notons n√©anmoins que le studio a offert le jeu aux joueurs qui poss√©daient d√©j√† les jeux originaux. Je ne m'attendais d'ailleurs pas √† le recevoir. Trop habitu√© √† ce que l'on me demande de payer pour refaire Sniper Elite ou Saints Row The Third en top qualit√©. Voil√† d√©j√† une qualit√© que nous pouvons souligner.Pour le c√¥t√© graphique, j'ai beaucoup appr√©ci√© le travail qui a √©t√© effectu√© concernant les visages et les √©motions, et c'est, je pense, la majeure partie du travail effectu√© sur ce remaster. Que pouvaient-ils apporter de plus ? Mafia II √©tait d√©j√† un jeu merveilleux pour l'√©poque. Pire encore, il n'a m√™me pas vieilli. Donc √† moins d'en faire un remake, ils ne pouvaient pas non plus apporter grand chose ?Et pourtant, ils ont rajout√© quelque chose : une quantit√© assez impressionnante de bugs en tout genre. A tel point que le jeu est tout simplement injouable !Les bugs bloquent la progression dans l'histoire. Ca peut √™tre assez large, comme un sol sans collision ou un blackscreen qui bloque syst√©matiquement le jeu apr√®s une cin√©matique. J'ai pu faire le jeu une premi√®re fois sans soucis, et je ne peux plus le refaire sur mon nouvel ordinateur qui est bien plus puissant. Le probl√®me ? Hangar 13.Fi√®re de ses 2 opus, Mafia √©tait une s√©rie assez forte. Hangar 13 a √©t√© en charge de d√©velopper Mafia III dans une p√©riode fascinante et horrible de New Orl√©ans. Et dire qu'ils se sont plant√©, √ßa n'est pas assez. Mafia III est l'une des plus mauvais open world, sinon le pire. Rien ne va avec ce jeu, c'est une v√©ritable catastrophe. Sur PC, il a d'ailleurs √©t√© fait n'importe comment, ce qui fait qu'il est tr√®s difficile de le faire tourner en bonne qualit√© sans consumer ses composants d'ordinateur. C'est d'ailleurs toujours le cas, si bien que l'on doit installer des mods communautaires pour y jouer sans avoir envie de d√©gueuler.Je trouve particuli√®rement irresponsable d'avoir confi√© √† ce maudit studio le remaster de ces jeux merveilleux. Ils avaient d√©j√† viol√© Mafia III, pourquoi prendre le risque avec les anciens jeux ?! Le principal changement, c'est que l'on doit attendre d'avoir achev√© certaines parties avant de d√©bloquer des v√©hicules sp√©ciaux de DLC, que l'on avait automatiquement dans la version originale. Petit plus, si vous poss√©dez Mafia III, vous avez automatiquement la voiture de Lincoln Clay dans votre garage. Au vu de sa vitesse et du d√©calage anachronique, c'est un peu comme jouer avec les codes de triche, mais √ßa reste cool.

Ce jeu est totalement inint√©ressant et vide. Il n'a d'√©gal que le comportement perfide des joueurs qui en peuplent les serveurs.  Lors de mon test, je pensais que ce jeu venait de sortir, que c'√©tait nouveau, et que donc, nous √©tions dans de l'EA. Mais dej√†, on en voyait les limites. Alors, constater que ce jeu est en vente depuis 2017, mais, qu'en plus, l'EA est termin√©, √ßa me suffit amplement.Il est assez difficile de juger ce type de jeu, car la concurrence est rude. Pour vous donner un exemple, Day Of Infamy est sorti dans la m√™me p√©riode, et tout comme ce jeu, il √©tait l√©g√®rement chaotique et assez instable au lancement. Mais les d√©veloppeurs ont travaill√© dessus, ils ont chang√© des choses, rectifi√© les petits soucis et bugs. Dans le cas de Day Of War, c'est comme si rien n'avait √©t√© fait.D√©j√† parce qu'il manque des choses √©videntes ; la possibilit√© de se pencher en restant a couvert. Ca parait peut-√™tre mineur, mais √ßa manque beaucoup dans un FPS de ce type ou la pr√©cision est de mise. On rajoute √† √ßa des cartes qui sont belles mais d√©s√©quilibr√©es & mal pens√©es. Tellement mal, qu'il ne suffit que de quelques parties pour "" choper "" les endroits ou se cacher. Une faille qui attire une certaines communaut√©, les joueurs malhonn√™te. En effet, si vous aimez profiter des zones de transparence, des petits bugs de map et des endroits camouflage, je vous recommande ce jeu. Attention cependant, car la concurrence est rude pour trouver son emplacement de camping.Donc, l'on a un jeu beau, qui tourne tr√®s bien, le tout avec un communaut√© qui ruine le jeu, d√©j√† qu'il est difficile de lui trouver des points fort ... L'on rajoute √† √ßa les probl√®mes avec le filtrage audio. J'ai horreur de jouer et d'entendre un autre joueur qui commente tout en enregistrant le bruit lamentable de son clavier juste parce que ce dernier veut parler en jouant mais n'est pas assez √©duqu√© pour s'acheter un micro de chat ( Astuce : Ca peut se trouver a moins de 5‚Ç?chez Action ).Le probl√®me se pose car l'on ne peut que partiellement muter le canal VOIP, des fois on entend les joueurs parler malgr√®s le filtre, et sist√©matiquement, on entend tout le monde parler √† la fin de la manche et durant les √©crans de chargement. Entre les bruits de mecs qui gueulent, les autres qui tapent sur leur clavier et l'ordi portable packard bell qui fait un brut de r√©acteur de fus√©e, le mal de cr√¢ne est garanti ...En r√©sum√©, il m'a suffit de tr√®s peu de temps de jeu pour constater la m√©diocrit√© de ce jeu, je ne vois m√™me pas pourquoi je devrais lui donner une seconde chance, Day Of Infamy est bien mieux, il y'a une communaut√© respectueuse et plus grande, et le comble dans tout √ßa ?

Du fait de sa petite taille, il a √©t√© tr√®s rapide de t√©l√©charger le jeu, √† peine moins de  500 mb. Et que penser de ce jeu ? Il est excellent.Le Die and Retry, un type de jeu assez frustrant qui revient en force depuis quelques ann√©es. On peut penser aux plus c√©l√®bres de la d√©cennie, Hotline Miami, Super Meat Boy ou encore SuperHot. C'est un principe assez simple, le tout pour un jeu limit√© : vous devez effectuer une action, atteindre un endroit sous une limite de temps ou encore rester en vie durant l'accomplissement de l'objectif. Ainsi, la dur√©e de temps que vous pouvez passer sur ce type de jeu est extr√©mement variable, ce temps pouvant passer du double au triple. Au fil du jeu, et √† mesure que votre connaissance se paufine, vos reflex s'am√©liorent jusqu'√† triompher du jeu. Ce m√©canisme est l'objectif recherch√©. Il est mis en place par les d√©veloppeurs, et les joueurs l'ex√©cutent apr√®s avoir √©tudi√© le niveau.Le probl√®me dans ce type de jeu, c'est que c'est assez compliqu√© √† faire. C'est pourquoi beaucoup de jeux ind√© sortent chaque ann√©e, mais demeurent des √©checs. Je pense principalement √† l'√©chec de Season's Beating, ou encore Riskers, qui, pourtant, auraient pu √™tre de bon jeux. Le principal de ces jeux a √©t√© le manque de qualification pour le mapping. Des jeux comme Super Hot laissent une petite fen√™tre d'espoir, malgr√© un d√©c√®s, tandis que ces autres jeux √©taient tout simplement frustrant. Concernant ce jeu, vous descendez une pente abrupte avec des obstacles √† la clef, ou encore pire, des ravins. Il faut doser entre l'acc√©l√©rateur et le freinage, g√©rer entre l'envie de battre un score, ou l'intention d'arriver avec le moins de "" crash "" possible. Apr√®s une premi√®re pente, et environs 7 checkpoints de pass√©, l'on vous propose de refaire cette piste avec des objectifs en plus. A chaque checkpoint, le temps est mis entre parenth√®se. Il y'a un temps auquel vous avez pass√© le checkpoint, et un temps qui dit combien de temps vous allez passer entre le premier et le deuxi√®me checkpoint. Si vous chuter, ce temps revient √† celui ou vous √©tiez en passant le premier checkpoint.Il faut bien prendre en compte l'absorption des chocs, qui fait que vous ne pouvez pas supporter des sauts sur une grande hauteur, ce qui colle avec le r√©alisme de ce sport √† sensation. Des VTT plus r√©sistant avec des sp√©cialisations se d√©bloquent en accomplissant les d√©fis du jeu.Je ne pense que le prix de 19.99 soit correct pour un tel jeu, je ne le commercialiserai pas au-dessus de 9.99‚Ç? mais le d√©veloppeur a quand-m√™me pass√© plusieurs ann√©es dessus avec un crowfunding kickstarter.

Le jeu se pr√©sente plut√¥t comme un film, ou du moins, il se joue "" comme "". Cam√©ra √† l'√©paule, plans risqu√© mais beau,ou des fois m√™me tout simplement foireux. Sauf que l'on ne peut pas jouer √† un jeu comme l'on regarde un film. Lynch est probablement le personnage, derri√®re un homme adorable et dou√© de sensibilit√© se cache un sociopathe antipathique. C'est assez bien expliqu√© dans le premier opus : il y'a deux hommes qui sommeillent en lui. Honn√™tement, je me demande m√™me si son personnage n'a pas inspir√© notre c√©l√®bre Trevor, repr√©sent√© par Steven Ogg. Il y'a m√™me une ressemblance physique assez importante.L'ancien homme tente d√©sesperemant de mettre son pass√© d'homme derri√®re lui. C'√©tait sans compter sur le lot de soucis de Kane va lui apporter en implorant son aide. A savoir que les deux homme se sont rencontr√© dans le premier opus, Kane √©tant le Liam Nison √† la recherche de sa fille kidnapp√©, et Lynch l'homme de main des kidnappeurs. Les deux vont malgr√© eux une confiance r√©ciproque.Ce jeu nous ram√®ne dans les rues bond√©es de l'Asie moderne. De trahisons en pis, les deux personnages se retrouvent traqu√© par une arm√©e enti√®re aux trousses. Ce qu'est int√©ressant dans ce jeu mais qui est explique qu'il peut √™tre un peu d√©routant : la cam√©ra √† la 3 personnes. Comme dit plus haut, on parle de prise √† l'√©paule ou √† la hanche, ce qui explique les tremblements fr√©quents et les balances al√©atoire de focus.

Evidemment, on compare avec les films comparables, notamment Tueur n√© et Volte Face.Le manque d'histoire est totalement assum√©, on ne sait pas ou ils vont, on ne comprend ni le d√©but ni la fin : le but, c'est survivre. Tr√®s bon atout sur lequel je trouve important d'insister, vous pouvez jouer au jeu en coop, chacun sur votre PC. Ainsi, il est possible de faire la campagne aupr√®s d'un ami. C'est vraiment tr√®s sympa. Il est difficile de trouver du monde sur un jeu aussi vieux, mais √ßa peut arriver !En conclusion un jeu quand-m√™me potable.

No matter if you played MGS 1, 2 ,3 , etc or if you only play FPS' this game is for you, there's a giant twisting ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?story that I've managed to follow (mostly) for more seasoned followers of the franchise; it helps that I used to play MGS 2 and 3 continuously.This time the stealth is much more lenient and there is more focus on action which gets sort of annoying at times but for a more authentic experience simply lower the brightness and turn reflex mode off: this is how I reccomend playing this game if you're not a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•' ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô? When you get bored of sneaking around like some sort of mole-rat you can always don some battle armour and storm the gates of a heavily guarded outpost with an assortment of weapons such as LMGS, launchers,  grenades, assault rifles (which all have non-lethal alternatives if you want to do a swat-style raid) leaving no man alive in your devastating wake all while ""REBEL YELLLLLL"" plays from your 1980s custom cassete mixtape (that you stole from earlier outposts).The story gets progressively more interesting at the cost of also becoming progressively more confusing. The supernatural aspects of the story felt somewhat forced in my opinion since these moments are no doubt juxtaposed, by me and other players of older games of the franchise, with the hyperrealistic details and aspects of the old games: smoking ciggerettes make laser sensors visible, and carboard boxes break in the rain...But in TPP magical grey aliens exist and can throw giant rocks...eh it's aight I guess.Yeah just get it seriously, 25 quid is a ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô?deal considering I spent about ¬£75 on this but I don't regret it, it's already gave me over 110 hours (including console hours) of enjoyment and has got me to change my phone wallpaper to the Diamond Dogs logo because kojima is a direct blood reletive to one of his probable various oriental gods and this is the last we will (truly) see of his beautiful masterpeice that is the Metal Gear franchise.

I sinply didn't feel anything or wasn't able to interpret my feelings + I'm visually impaired (almost blind) + I've become emotionaly numb over the past 8 years. So it's either one of those or a combination of those reason why I didn't enjoy it as much. But the game is still worth while.Thankfully that discontinued the use of the horrible font used in the 2nd part of the trilogy.Secret words1: Love2: Selfcare3:CompassionTRIGGER WARNINGdon't read on if you easily get disturbed by topics like depression and suicide.YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT MEI'M IN THERAPY 4 TIMES A WEEK.I'm just puking out my thoughts after playing the trilogy and trying to verbalize my feelings. If you're intrested in messy minds feel free to read on but it doesn't have anything to do with a ""review""I haven't cried since I was 14, I'm 22 now.I played the trilogy in a binge session and wasn''t phased by anything in it untill the end of the third game (this one). Tears started rolling at the end of this chapter cause' I realized that I'm not really ""living"". I've been suicidal for almost a decade. The game didn't change that, at least not yet. But it started an important thought process and made me, well realize is not the right word since I already knew what the game told me, it rather made me remeber it again.I haven't been living life for me, I just keep on because of my mother who became blind a few years ago. And don't want to leave her in a situation like this and help her as much as I can with the little eyesight I was born with. I really don't know what makes her keep on going cuase' definitely kill myself if I'd lose the little eyesight I have. And she lost way more, since she was able to see perfectly fine.I also didn't inherit my ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• eyes from my mother. My half-brother has no disabilities at all.She lost one eye ages ago after getting hit by a drunk driver (she was not in a car).She was in the hospital for months because basicly half of her bones were broken and the retina of her right eye got disconnected from her optic nerve. And the retina in her left eye started to losen up but she was still able to see quite well (~80% of regular eyesight).Then 20 years later it slowly started to losen up more all of a sudden. The doctors told her that she'll probably have ~5-7 years from now onm till she'll turn blind and recommended her to get some eye surgery done before it's too late. My mom trusted the ""professional"" and agreed to the surgery. Well what can I say, they totally f**ked up and turned her blind istantly instead of letting her enjoy her eyeseight for a few more years.Now my eyesight started degrating too. Thankfully it's a really slow process and my case is very complicated so there is no way to fix my eyes with any kind of surgery. I really love my mother, she allways did her best to make my life as great as possible. I really appreciate that since I seen many bad examples from other students in my school and friends.I really hope I become blind after my mother passes away. If my eyes kick the bucket before she passes away it'll be the hardest decision I'll ever have to make. Since I basicly already chose to end myself if become blind. If my mother wouldn't have had that accident and therefore wouldn't have any problems with her eyes I'd probably be dead already.I know that I'll hurt many people by chosing death but I simply can't live just for other peoples' sakes. I'm fine with beeing an ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô? I'd rather have my friends hate me rather than missing me.That way it'll be easier for them to forget me.My mom is a special case, cause like I said thanks to her I always had everything I needed. She was always there me.But what I'm doing right now can't be called ""living"".I have no goals in life and can't make up any cause' I simply don't care.I dropped all of my hobbies over time and can't bring myself to do them anymore even though I very much enjoyed them ages ago.So all I do currenty is:Help my mother with her daily(Shopping, cooking, paperwork)Attend my apprenticeship in the IT branch to earn money.I sometimes meet friends, if they have.At home I usually procrastinate and mindlessly watch YouTube or Netflix etc.I have to write monthly reports wich I have to submit when I want to attend the Exams.I'm four months behind and can't get my ass up to write them, instead I waste my energy on writing this wall of text.I'm in sort of an autopilot mode, my memory is so broken I can't even rember what happened a few days ago. I simply don't pay attention to anything anymore because I just want life to get over with.Days seem past me really quicly but at the same time it feels like an eternity till I can finally rest.I don't know if this game will bring back my will to live and I don't expect it to do so.However this game stirred up some emotions in me. This is quite an acomplishmed considering my emotional numbness in the past 8 years.The only time I actually feel clearly distinguishable emotion is when I enter manic episodes due to my bipolar disorder. But during those episodes I'm the only one who has fun and enjoys it because my Friends an Family eventually get hurt by my manic behavior.So I take medications that are supposed to stabilize my mood, however since I know how good the manic phases feel everything bellow that level just feels dull.It's the same pricipal with you can't miss it if you don't know it.When a person is born bild in the first place the chance is way higher that the person is fine with it and adopts well to the disability. On the other hand if you know what it's like to see losing that ability hits way harder. Same goes for the manic episodes.I tested a lot of   d r u 6 $ and none of them even remotely rech the ""high"" of a manic episode.I have no conclusion yet, I'd really want to end it before I lose all my eyesight, since tying a noose isn't that easy when just lost your eyesight.For now I'll simply continue my monotone zombie life since I don't know what to do about it and lack the energy to find out.Thank you for publishing this game series.I wish everyone a great day and hope you didn't get depressed nor confused from my giant thoughts puke								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1428310,15-Apr,2.5,2,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The storyline is pretty nice, the lighting is absolutely amazing, the costumes are so breathtaking. The Devs are indeed doing an incredible job, keep at it guys!!!!SPOILERS AHEAD!!I will say, a few things that disappointed me, but I do understand cos early access, the fact that the crypts in the swamp can be very buggy. Playing multiplayer things got lost, deleted, duplicated. It became very frustrating. Ships destroying for no reason near the shore, no rocks or anything. Enemies getting glitched and annoying the heck out of everything around. Im not sure if the fullings are meant to be that powerful? Maybe tone the amount of damage they do down a little bit? The sea serpents spawning bugged for us, so now none will spawn, whereas we would see 4 every single in game day, previously. Those are really my only complaints tbh. I will say keep up the amazing work guys and I am seriously looking forward to the new and exciting content! :)								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/892970,"5 March, 2021",202.7,141.9,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I have to come off the bat to say its a 9/10 the one big side down to this is that there isn't really a campaign to this game. Its just a overall a original battle front 2 galatic conquest at its basics. Although its very similar to Warhammer Dawn of War Game of the year edition it has a few more factions including a advance robot faction and the big scary green guys on the cover. The game play isn't bad at all often being very fun capturing and holding new lands that give requsition and other little bonuses such as attack movement and the amazing honor guards that you spawn in with in each new battle. What i do like to see that if capture and hold a area what ever defenses you last left there is still there to work with. One down side of this is you cant capture the whole map if you do what ever that spawns in spawns on your HQ in that one are and destroys everything if you're not fast enough to train units and stop them. Over all this game is great for a cheap price and i recommend playing it with some friends to do some battles.

Brought hours of fun with multiple factions to play with dynamic unit selection. Has a strong campaign and a fun story line. One of the few story lines i actually get invested into cause it actually pulled me in. It has a bottom line of being unique and a original game. You can create massive battles with elite units or just have a swarm of weak and watch them battle it. Also allowing the units have multiple other weapons equiped too also makes them even more dynamic also allowing some faction spawn some of their own bosses like the Eldar's fire god and the Chao's Demon. This is a overall a 10/10 game for me i have no problem with it and its hours of fun for a cheap price.

He has multiple of the same game publish like updated versions of it and still making you pay money for these updated games other then updating this game and making it better. He has so little effort in this game its sad. When i started it, it was actually decent the looks and graphics of the game i really liked. But when it comes to the NPC's the hitboxs to them and the overall game in it self just dived into just horrible nonsense. The NPC's often ran in a straight line to you making them easy targets and making them all spawned in one area lagged the game and make many of them die instantly from tripping over one of another. You could get in a car and be instantly invincible watching the cops trying to get you and just dying from a stopped car. The game is do what ever you want which is basically just drive around, kill people, walk, or just buying items from horribly decorated stores and filled with just a few items each.I honestly believe this guy just made this game for the cash and nothing else so little work was put into this game. If it was a free game i would of accepted it and liked it knowing they probably just did this for the players enjoyment and trying hard to learn by making video games while making us the player know that,  other then just trying to take our money. If it was free i would give this game a positive review but the lack of effort the horrible making of it the crappy one liner dialogue for the characters and having no story and crappy NPC's it looks like he just made this in a single day. If you ever wish to talk to a RANDOM NPC you just talked them and say one of THREE things. 1 Hi2 Follow3 StayThats it. The horrible purchasing mechanic of weapons is that you need to repurchase a weapon for its ammo. Hey want 4 clips? Well you need to pay a extra 100$ for a new gun thats even empty. You can't stack you have to wait to empty the gun out to get more ammo unless you're just wasting money. Even getting and earning cash in this game is sad. Kill civilians to get 1-10$ each. Or if you really wish look for a spawn point collect the cash (since a lot of them tripped and died) or just get in a car and get a wanted level and just walk away for 3 minutes come back, die and collect all the cash which takes way to long to pick up, picking each one up individually is annoying to say the least.

Also in the game there is a very wide variety of weapons, you can play as a sniper, hiding behind some cover, and as an attack aircraft who will fight off the captured territory.Another disadvantage of the game is cheaters, there are more of them than you think, the developers are not trying to do anything about it.Let's get down to the pluses of this creation:- Dynamic battles.- Having even hands, you can do without donation and knock out all the weapons without problems.- Optimization- Creative mod, in which you can create a map with your chips and then start a server for players and your friends.- Many modes will not let you get bored.- FreeToPlay game.Now to the cons:- Donut, which gives you an advantage in weapons.- Cheaters, in this game you will meet quite a few of them.- Very rare events and updates.- Mediocre graphics, there are several analogues that are 99.9% identical- There is no way to ban / kick cheaters from the server.- Lack of anti-cheat.RUS:BLOCKPOST - —Å–º–µ—Å—å Minecraft –∏ Counter Strike : Global Offensive, –∏–≥—Ä–∞ –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∞ –≤ –∫—É–±–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–º —Å—Ç–∏–ª–µ,–∫–∞–∫ –∏ –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ –ø–æ–¥–æ–±–Ω—ã—Ö –∏–≥—Ä –≤ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–º –∂–∞–Ω—Ä–µ.–í –¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∏–≥—Ä–µ –≤—ã –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏—Ç–µ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –¥–æ–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –≤ –∫–∞–∫–æ–π —Ç–æ —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ –≤–ª–∏—è–µ—Ç –Ω–∞ –∏–≥—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –≥–µ–π–º–ø–ª–µ–π, –Ω–æ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ —Ç–∞–∫ –∂–µ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –≤—ã–±–∏—Ç—å –∏–∑ —Å—É–Ω–¥—É–∫–æ–≤ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –≤—ã–ø–æ–ª–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—è –æ–ø—Ä–µ–¥–µ–ª—ë–Ω–Ω—ã—Ö –∑–∞–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π, –∏ –ø–æ–≤—ã—à–µ–Ω–∏–µ —É—Ä–æ–≤–Ω—è –∞–∫–∫–∞—É–Ω—Ç–∞.–ì–µ–π–º–ª–µ–π –≤ –∏–≥—Ä–µ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –¥–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏—á–Ω—ã–π,—É –≤–∞—Å –Ω–µ –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –≤—Ä–µ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –∑–∞—Å–∫—É—á–∞—Ç—å.–¢–∞–∫ –∂–µ –≤ –∏–≥—Ä–µ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–µ —Ä–∞–∑–Ω–æ–æ–±—Ä–∞–∑–∏–µ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è,–≤—ã –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç–µ –æ—Ç—ã–≥—Ä—ã–≤–∞—Ç—å –∫–∞–∫ —Å–Ω–∞–π–ø–µ—Ä–∞,—Å–ø—Ä—è—Ç–∞–≤—à–∏—Å—å –∑–∞ –∫–∞–∫–∏–º –Ω–∏–±—É–¥—å —É–∫—Ä—ã—Ç–∏–µ–º,—Ç–∞–∫ –∏ –∑–∞ —à—Ç—É—Ä–º–æ–≤–∏–∫–∞ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –æ—Ç–±–∏–≤–∞—Ç—å –∑–∞—Ö–≤–∞—á–µ–Ω–Ω—É—é —Ç–µ—Ä—Ä–∏—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é.–ï—â–µ –æ–¥–∏–Ω –º–∏–Ω—É—Å –∏–≥—Ä—ã - —á–∏—Ç–µ—Ä—ã,–∏—Ö –±–æ–ª—å—à–µ —á–µ–º –≤—ã –¥—É–º–∞–µ—Ç–µ,—Ä–∞–∑—Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç—á–∏–∫–∏ –Ω–∏—á–µ–≥–æ —Å —ç—Ç–∏–º –Ω–µ –ø—ã—Ç–∞—é—Ç—Å—è –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å.–ü—Ä–∏—Å—Ç—É–ø–∏–º –∫ –ø–ª—é—Å–∞–º –¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ç–≤–æ—Ä–µ–Ω–∏—è :- –î–∏–Ω–∞–º–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–µ —Å—Ä–∞–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è.- –ò–º–µ—è —Ä–æ–≤–Ω—ã–µ —Ä—É–∫–∏ –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ –æ–±–æ–π—Ç–∏—Å—å –±–µ–∑ –¥–æ–Ω–∞—Ç–∞ –∏ –≤—ã–±–∏—Ç—å –≤—Å–µ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–µ –±–µ–∑ –ø—Ä–æ–±–ª–µ–º.- –û–ø—Ç–∏–º–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—è- –ö—Ä–µ–∞—Ç–∏–≤ –º–æ–¥,–≤ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–º –º–æ–∂–Ω–æ —Å–æ–∑–¥–∞—Ç—å –∫–∞—Ä—Ç—É —Å–æ —Å–≤–æ–∏–º–∏ —Ñ–∏—à–∫–∞–º–∏ –∏ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º –∑–∞–ø—É—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—å —Å–µ—Ä–≤–µ—Ä –¥–ª—è –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫–æ–≤ –∏ —Å–≤–æ–∏—Ö –¥—Ä—É–∑–µ–π.- –ú–Ω–æ–∂–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ —Ä–µ–∂–∏–º–æ–≤ –Ω–µ –¥–∞–¥—É—Ç –≤–∞–º –∑–∞—Å–∫—É—á–∞—Ç—å.- FreeToPlay –∏–≥—Ä–∞.–¢–µ–ø–µ—Ä—å –∫ –º–∏–Ω—É—Å–∞–º:- –î–æ–Ω–∞—Ç,–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –¥–∞—ë—Ç –≤–∞–º –ø—Ä–µ–∏–º—É—â–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ –≤ –≤–æ–æ—Ä—É–∂–µ–Ω–∏–∏.- –ß–∏—Ç–µ—Ä—ã,–≤ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω–æ–π –∏–≥—Ä–µ –≤—ã –∏—Ö –≤—Å—Ç—Ä–µ—Ç–∏—Ç–µ –Ω–µ –º–∞–ª–æ.- –û—á–µ–Ω—å —Ä–µ–¥–∫–∏–µ –∏–≤–µ–Ω—Ç—ã –∏ –æ–±–Ω–æ–≤–ª–µ–Ω–∏—è.- –ü–æ—Å—Ä–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–µ–Ω–Ω–∞—è –≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏–∫–∞,–µ—Å—Ç—å –Ω–µ—Å–∫–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –∞–Ω–∞–ª–æ–≥–æ–≤ –∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ç–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –Ω–∞ 99.9%- –ù–µ—Ç –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏ –±–∞–Ω–∏—Ç—å/–∫–∏–∫–∞—Ç—å —á–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–≤ —Å —Å–µ—Ä–≤–µ—Ä–∞.- –û—Ç—Å—É—Ç—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –∞–Ω—Ç–∏—á–∏—Ç–∞.

Paradox as of now make some of the better grand strategy games on the market, but their DLC policy is nothing short of greedy evil gremlins. This will turn into a $200+ game to get access to the ""full"" experience. It seems for single player they shifted focus on optimization and refinement of game mechanics, to flashy alt history and even more broken mechanics. I bought this game when it just came out of beta and there are still bugs from 4 years ago. Paradox thinks that people will shrug off poor mechanics in favor for new exciting DLC and right now they are right. Until people stop supporting such crude marketing (myself included) they will milk us dry before they fix their game. The only saving grace is the extensive mod community which is great for both multiplayer and singleplayer.RUS: –≠—Ç–æ –æ—Ç–Ω–æ—à–µ–Ω–∏—è –ª—é–±–≤–∏ –∏ –Ω–µ–Ω–∞–≤–∏—Å—Ç–∏ —Å Hearts of Iron. –ü–∞—Ä–∞–¥–æ–∫—Å –Ω–∞ –¥–∞–Ω–Ω—ã–π –º–æ–º–µ–Ω—Ç –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—Ç –Ω–µ–∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–µ –∏–∑ –ª—É—á—à–∏—Ö –≤–µ–ª–∏–∫–∏—Ö —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏—Ö –∏–≥—Ä –Ω–∞ —Ä—ã–Ω–∫–µ, –Ω–æ –∏—Ö –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–∞ DLC - –Ω–µ —á—Ç–æ –∏–Ω–æ–µ, –∫–∞–∫ –∂–∞–¥–Ω—ã–µ –∑–ª—ã–µ –≥—Ä–µ–º–ª–∏–Ω—ã. –≠—Ç–æ –ø—Ä–µ–≤—Ä–∞—Ç–∏—Ç—Å—è –≤ –∏–≥—Ä—É –∑–∞ 200 –¥–æ–ª–ª–∞—Ä–æ–≤, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –ø–æ–ª—É—á–∏—Ç—å –¥–æ—Å—Ç—É–ø –∫ ¬´–ø–æ–ª–Ω–æ–º—É¬ª –æ–ø—ã—Ç—É. –ö–∞–∂–µ—Ç—Å—è, —á—Ç–æ –¥–ª—è –æ–¥–∏–Ω–æ—á–Ω–æ–≥–æ –∏–≥—Ä–æ–∫–∞ –æ–Ω–∏ –ø–µ—Ä–µ–∫–ª—é—á–∏–ª–∏ –≤–Ω–∏–º–∞–Ω–∏–µ –Ω–∞ –æ–ø—Ç–∏–º–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—é –∏ —É—Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–µ –∏–≥—Ä–æ–≤–æ–π –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫–∏, –Ω–∞ –±—Ä–æ—Å–∫—É—é –∏—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–∏—é –∏ –µ—â–µ –±–æ–ª–µ–µ —Å–ª–æ–º–∞–Ω–Ω—É—é –º–µ—Ö–∞–Ω–∏–∫—É. –Ø –∫—É–ø–∏–ª —ç—Ç—É –∏–≥—Ä—É, –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ –æ–Ω–∞ —Ç–æ–ª—å–∫–æ –≤—ã—à–ª–∞ –∏–∑ –±–µ—Ç–∞-–≤–µ—Ä—Å–∏–∏ –∏ –µ—Å—Ç—å –æ—à–∏–±–∫–∏ 4 –≥–æ–¥–∞ –Ω–∞–∑–∞–¥.

For every wound there is a goal - to get a lot of coins in the N degree. Each time you reach the goal, you reset and start again, with small improvements for the next wound, but the new goal moves further noticeably.For the most part, you need to look for different tactics and ways to achieve the greatest increase in coins, so I would call this game purely logical and mathematical. For example, to get all the achievements you will have to make a lot of rerana, but just what distinguishes this game from the rest is the ability to achieve the goal in a huge number of ways, which, as a rule, you need to go with your own head. So the combination of grind with strategy is a very interesting pleasure, but in the long run pastime is rather doubtful).In fact, at any other time I wouldn‚Äôt disappear in it, it‚Äôs rather convenient when you do something outside at the computer, and this game is launched in the background and you can sometimes be distracted to buy new buildings / studies in it, and back to business again. So if you decide to go through it, I recommend doing it while you dig in the browser / do simple work or generally any nonsense between games.RUS: –≠—Ç–∞ ""–∏–≥—Ä–∞"" —Ç–æ—á–Ω–æ –Ω–µ –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–º—É –±—É–¥–µ—Ç –ø–æ –¥—É—à–µ, –Ω–æ —Ç–∞–∫ –∫–∞–∫ –æ–Ω–∞ –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–∞—è, –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π –º–æ–∂–µ—Ç –ø–æ–ø—ã—Ç–∞—Ç—å—Å—è –≤ –Ω–µ–π —á—Ç–æ-—Ç–æ –Ω–∞–π—Ç–∏ =)–°—É—Ç—å –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –≤ —Ç–æ–º, —á—Ç–æ–±—ã —Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –∏ —Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞ —Ñ–∞—Ä–º–∏—Ç—å –Ω–µ–∫–æ–µ –≤–Ω—É—Ç—Ä–∏–∏–≥—Ä–æ–≤–æ–µ –∑–æ–ª–æ—Ç–æ. –ù–∞ –∫–∞–∂–¥—ã–π —Ä–∞–Ω –µ—Å—Ç—å —Ü–µ–ª—å - –¥–æ–±—ã—Ç—å –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ –º–æ–Ω–µ—Ç –≤ —Å—Ç–µ–ø–µ–Ω–∏ N. –ö–∞–∂–¥—ã–π —Ä–∞–∑ –ø–æ—Å–ª–µ –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è —Ü–µ–ª–∏, –≤—ã –¥–µ–ª–∞–µ—Ç–µ —Å–±—Ä–æ—Å, –∏ –Ω–∞—á–∏–Ω–∞–µ—Ç–µ –∑–∞–Ω–æ–≤–æ, —Å –Ω–µ–±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–º–∏ —É–ª—É—á—à–µ–Ω–∏—è–º–∏ –¥–ª—è —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–µ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–Ω–∞, –Ω–æ –∏ –Ω–æ–≤–∞—è —Ü–µ–ª—å –æ—Ç–æ–¥–≤–∏–≥–∞–µ—Ç—Å—è –∑–∞–º–µ—Ç–Ω–æ –¥–∞–ª—å—à–µ.–í –±–æ–ª—å—à–∏–Ω—Å—Ç–≤–µ —Å–≤–æ—ë–º –∑–¥–µ—Å—å –Ω–∞–¥–æ –∏—Å–∫–∞—Ç—å —Ä–∞–∑–Ω—ã–µ —Ç–∞–∫—Ç–∏–∫–∏ –∏ —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±—ã –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏—è –Ω–∞–∏–±–æ–ª—å—à–µ–≥–æ –ø—Ä–∏—Ä–æ—Å—Ç–∞ –º–æ–Ω–µ—Ç, —Ç–∞–∫ —á—Ç–æ —è –Ω–∞–∑–≤–∞–ª –±—ã —ç—Ç—É –∏–≥—Ä—É —Å—É–≥—É–±–æ –ª–æ–≥–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ-–º–∞—Ç–µ–º–∞—Ç–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–æ–π. –ù–∞–ø—Ä–∏–º–µ—Ä, –¥–ª—è –ø–æ–ª—É—á–µ–Ω–∏—è –≤—Å–µ—Ö –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏–∂–µ–Ω–∏–π –ø—Ä–∏–¥—ë—Ç—Å—è —Å–¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–µ—Ä–∞–Ω–æ–≤, –Ω–æ –∫–∞–∫ —Ä–∞–∑ —Ç–æ —á—Ç–æ –æ—Ç–ª–∏—á–∞–µ—Ç —ç—Ç—É –∏–≥—Ä—É –æ—Ç –æ—Å—Ç–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã—Ö, —Ç–∞–∫ —ç—Ç–æ –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å –¥–æ—Å—Ç–∏—á—å —Ü–µ–ª–∏ –æ–≥—Ä–æ–º–Ω—ã–º –∫–æ–ª–∏—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–æ–º —Å–ø–æ—Å–æ–±–æ–≤, –¥–æ –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã—Ö, –∫–∞–∫ –ø—Ä–∞–≤–∏–ª–æ, –Ω–∞–¥–æ –¥–æ–π—Ç–∏ —Å–≤–æ–µ–π –≥–æ–ª–æ–≤–æ–π. –¢–∞–∫ —á—Ç–æ —Å–æ—á–µ—Ç–∞–Ω–∏–µ –≥—Ä–∏–Ω–¥–∞ —Å–æ —Å—Ç—Ä–∞—Ç–µ–≥–∏–µ–π —ç—Ç–æ –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –∏–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–µ—Å–Ω–æ–µ —É–¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ, –Ω–æ –≤ –¥–æ–ª–≥–æ—Å—Ä–æ—á–Ω–æ–π –ø–µ—Ä—Å–ø–µ–∫—Ç–∏–≤–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è–ø—Ä–æ–≤–æ–∂–¥–µ–Ω–∏—è –¥–æ–≤–æ–ª—å–Ω–æ —Å–æ–º–Ω–∏—Ç–µ–ª—å–Ω–æ–µ).–ù–∞ —Å–∞–º–æ–º –¥–µ–ª–µ, –≤ –ª—é–±–æ–µ –¥—Ä—É–≥–æ–µ –≤—Ä–µ–º—è —è –Ω–µ —Å—Ç–∞–ª –±—ã –≤ –Ω–µ–π –ø—Ä–æ–ø–∞–¥–∞—Ç—å, –æ–Ω–∞ —Å–∫–æ—Ä–µ–µ —É–¥–æ–±–Ω–∞ –∫–æ–≥–¥–∞ —Ç—ã –∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ—à—å—Å—è –∑–∞ –∫–æ–º–ø—å—é—Ç–µ—Ä–æ–º —á–µ–º-—Ç–æ –ø–æ—Å—Ç–æ—Ä–æ–Ω–Ω–∏–º, –∞ —ç—Ç–∞ –∏–≥—Ä–∞ –∑–∞–ø—É—â–µ–Ω–∞ –Ω–∞ —Ñ–æ–Ω–µ –∏ —Ç—ã –∏–Ω–æ–≥–¥–∞ –º–æ–∂–µ—à—å –æ—Ç–≤–ª–µ—á—å—Å—è —á—Ç–æ–±—ã –¥–æ–∫—É–ø–∏—Ç—å –≤ –Ω–µ–π –Ω–æ–≤—ã—Ö –∑–¥–∞–Ω–∏–π/–∏—Å—Å–ª–µ–¥–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏–π, –∏ —Å–Ω–æ–≤–∞ –≤–µ—Ä–Ω—É—Ç—å—Å—è –≤ —Å–≤–æ–∏ –¥–µ–ª–∞. –¢–∞–∫ —á—Ç–æ –µ—Å–ª–∏ –∏ —Ä–µ—à–∏—Ç–µ—Å—å –ø—Ä–æ–π—Ç–∏ –µ—ë, —Ä–µ–∫–æ–º–µ–Ω–¥—É—é —ç—Ç–æ –¥–µ–ª–∞—Ç—å –ø–æ–∫–∞ –≤—ã –∫–æ–ø–∞–µ—Ç–µ—Å—å –≤ –±—Ä–∞—É–∑–µ—Ä–µ/–∑–∞–Ω–∏–º–∞–µ—Ç–µ—Å—å –Ω–µ—Å–ª–æ–∂–Ω–æ–π —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–æ–π –∏–ª–∏ –≤–æ–æ–±—â–µ –ª—é–±–æ–π –µ—Ä—É–Ω–¥–æ–π –º–µ–∂–¥—É –∏–≥—Ä–∞–º–∏.

Great, in my opinion, the best storyline from the entire Grand Theft Auto series. There are a lot of different methods to have fun in the game if the game has already completed the storyline: from billiards and casinos, ending with the opportunity to work for a policeman / medic / fireman. But the storyline you will not go quickly, because it consists of more than 100 missions. Each character has his own character, which is very well felt. In dialogs and cut scenes there is a lot of sense. Also a nice bonus is the very popular multiplayer, and the fact that the game will go even on the weakest PCs and laptops.RUS: –û–¥–Ω–∞ –∏–∑ –ª—É—á—à–∏—Ö –∏–≥—Ä –Ω–∞ –ü–ö. –û—Ç–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã–π, –ø–æ –º–æ–µ–º—É –º–Ω–µ–Ω–∏—é –ª—É—á—à–∏–π —Å—é–∂–µ—Ç –∏–∑ –≤—Å–µ–π —Å–µ—Ä–∏–∏ Grand Theft Auto. –û—á–µ–Ω—å –º–Ω–æ–≥–æ —Ä–∞–∑–ª–∏—á–Ω—ã—Ö –º–µ—Ç–æ–¥–æ–≤ —Ä–∞–∑–≤–ª–µ—á—å—Å—è –≤ –∏–≥—Ä–µ, –µ—Å–ª–∏ –∏–≥—Ä–∞ —Å—é–∂–µ—Ç–Ω–∞—è –ª–∏–Ω–∏—è —É–∂–µ –ø—Ä–æ–π–¥–µ–Ω–∞: –æ—Ç –±–∏–ª—å—è—Ä–¥–∞ –∏ –∫–∞–∑–∏–Ω–æ, –∑–∞–∫–∞–Ω—á–∏–≤–∞—è –≤–æ–∑–º–æ–∂–Ω–æ—Å—Ç—å—é —Ä–∞–±–æ—Ç–∞—Ç—å –∑–∞ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ü–µ–π—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ/–º–µ–¥–∏–∫–∞/–ø–æ–∂–∞—Ä–Ω–æ–≥–æ. –ù–æ —Å—é–∂–µ—Ç–Ω—É—é –ª–∏–Ω–∏—é –≤—ã –ø—Ä–æ–π–¥–µ—Ç–µ –Ω–µ –±—ã—Å—Ç—Ä–æ, –≤–µ–¥—å –æ–Ω–∞ —Å–æ—Å—Ç–æ–∏—Ç –±–æ–ª–µ–µ —á–µ–º –∏–∑ 100 –º–∏—Å—Å–∏–π. –£ –∫–∞–∂–¥–æ–≥–æ –ø–µ—Ä—Å–æ–Ω–∞–∂–∞ –µ—Å—Ç—å —Å–≤–æ–π —Ö–∞—Ä–∞–∫—Ç–µ—Ä, –∫–æ—Ç–æ—Ä—ã–π –æ—á–µ–Ω—å —Ö–æ—Ä–æ—à–æ —á—É–≤—Å—Ç–≤—É–µ—Ç—Å—è. –í –¥–∏–∞–ª–æ–≥–∞—Ö –∏ –∫–∞—Ç-—Å—Ü–µ–Ω–∞—Ö –µ—Å—Ç—å –±–æ–ª—å—à–æ–π —Å–º—ã—Å–ª. –¢–∞–∫–∂–µ –ø—Ä–∏—è—Ç–Ω—ã–º –±–æ–Ω—É—Å–æ–º —è–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç—Å—è –æ—á–µ–Ω—å –ø–æ–ø—É–ª—è—Ä–Ω—ã–π –º—É–ª—å—Ç–∏–ø–ª–µ–µ—Ä, –∏ –µ—â–µ —Ç–æ, —á—Ç–æ –∏–≥—Ä–∞ –ø–æ–π–¥–µ—Ç –¥–∞–∂–µ –Ω–∞ —Å–∞–º—ã—Ö —Å–ª–∞–±—ã—Ö –ü–ö –∏ –Ω–æ—É—Ç–±—É–∫–∞—Ö.

It's no secret that I once broke the screen of my old cell phone because of this. Try to merge exactly 95% of the difficult level. Got an achievement? Did you get anything else? There, for example, sadness, anger, resentment, crunch in the end? If not, then you are the same person who does not take everything to heart, who can go through at least one demon level without a single psycho.Separately, why I fell in love with GD is a map editor.

In the world of Trove, everything was happy and calm while the Sun Goddess ruled, but at one point the Moon Goddess did not like such things, and since then an endless battle of light and darkness began. End. Moreover, additional information cannot be obtained, since there are no informational quests in the game.To play with a new class, there is no need to create a new character, this game will not let you do it anyway. It is enough to click on the desired interface button, and your hero is already a proud carrier of another class. At the very beginning, after completing the training, the player will be given the opportunity to receive one additional class for free. However, further to unlock new ones, you will need to either farm reagents for special crafting, or donate, if you are too lazy to waste time.Trove has a lot to do. The main focus of the game is on the grind. In fact, since this is a sandbox, each player determines the main goal for himself in his own way. For some, the goal will be to collect the maximum number of skins for their character, someone will want to get all mounts, and someone will want to pump all classes to the maximum level and get the coolest equipment at the moment.The maximum level of each class in the game is 30th. But beyond that, there is the so-called mastery level, which is capped at 700. Also, for a visual display of the effectiveness of the character, there is a Power Rank, which shows how cool your character is and is able to unwind enemies in different directions.This is a cubic MMO, where you can also mine cubic blocks, and then build whatever comes to mind from them.

There's a reason 96% of people rate this game as overwhelmingly positive.- This game had its budget mostly spent on the writers and it shows, it spends time building the world and characters and you genuinely care about them, even when you think you wont. LiS throws some tough decisions at you periodically throughout each chapter which will leave you emotionally drained for days as you think of nothing but what you just done. - The soundtrack is just fantastic, they got the music spot on with the tone of the game, you'll feel you're in a trance by the end of each episode as it winds down with the distinct music while you reflect on everything that's happened.- There are some gaping holes in the logic but the story really drags you in that it doesn't really matter, you're not thinking about it. The lip syncing could have done with some more work but again, you never really find that it's a problem since you're so immersed in whats going on. - People in the negative reviews say that your choices don't matter but they do, they reflect how people perceive and react to you as you progress through the story making each playthrough different when you notice things you can do differently the this time around influencing how you finish the game.- People will also rag on the it being episodic but it wouldn't work in any other format, they definitely made the right decision as it breaks the game into 5 distinct chunks rather than drone on for 15-20 hours, you'll play one episode a day, lie down and not stop thinking about what just happened, its truly a game that sticks with you.

1712,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035872602/recommended/,Other,1,Not Recommended,1,0," I would recommend the game, but here are the things that ruin it for me and can be easily fixed to improve the gameplay:  Respawning Very long respawn times on some servers - 15 seconds. Spawn points are very bad.  Often times, after waiting 15+ seconds to spawn, you will spend an additional 30 seconds walking to the front line.Sometimes, you will get there and just die in 5 seconds, so it gives a really bad feeling to the game sometimes. Weapon modes  Weapons have 2 modes to wield them. However, sometimes the alternative mode is to throw the weapon at the enemy and there is no way to know that, unless you remember for which weapon it happens.For some other weapons which are not thrown, there is no way to know in which weapon mode you are since the way it's held is obstructing the view or is being held in the wrong direction. Map Design Maps are very open which means that anyone can sneak up behind the front line and go all the way at the back, inside the castle or whatever defenses the map has.Usually, this means that the players with 1000+ hours will go back and kill people that have just spawned or are playing as an archer/crossbowman or whatever. Catapults Very high damage and big radius. Will insta kill everyone there but also your allies. Allies have friendly fire reduced to 1/4 of dmg but here it doesn't matter because the dmg is too big.Once you kill one of your teammates, these cancerous children will find you and team-attack you because they are feeling very angry. Horses Too easy to steer. To easy to move around. You will find horsemen chasing you through a building or something, navigating thin bridges and even across a single wooden plank.However, what is bad is once the horse has been stopped or slowed down, simply standing in front of it means it won't be able to move. At that point, it's very easy to kill the horseman.Lastly, there is a 5 second cooldown if you try to leave the map which can often times be too short to return and you die a very stupid death. The game doesn't calculate speed (or physics) You don't get speed bonus when hitting with additional speed. Things that I think are bad but might not be that easy to solve:  Weapon attack motion The weapon attack damage is the same no matter at which point you hit the enemy.This means that you can rotate your character to speed up or slow-down the attack. Also, it means that the person  can change targets mid attack and hit whoever is near just be moving their mouse very fast. Meanwhile, blocking has a cooldown, so the whole meta of this game is to manipulate the attack animation. Add the server pings and this makes deaths to feel very bad because often you die by being hit just at the end or just at the start of an animation, while the enemy hand is in a weird position. Also, often you see the enemy attacking, you press the block, the slow it down, your block expires, you get hit and die.

If you are looking for arcade fps experice, go play battlefield. If you are looking for singleplayer with realism experience, play something else.If you have bought this because of the reputation of realism of this game, bad luck.I heard this game is quite good, at least in the perspective of realism.However, what it really delivers is a really sluggish movement and control without any tutorials for which key to press and an arcade-ish combat experience. Movement and control:- Extremely weird and dumb key bindings- Really weird camera locking- Extremely small field of view. (Probably even smaller than horror games)- No options or what so ever for toggling. - Tutorials never tell you what key bindings for each action. Have fun searching in the option or googling it yourself.- Since spacebar is binded to standup and there is no option for jumping. You will frequently find yourself stuck between rocks.- The list goes on and on.Combat:- The enemy AI can spend all day long missing their shot even they are right next to you.- Hit-marker. Not great for a realism game in my opinion.- AIs can shoot at you even there are sh!t tons of trees and grass in front of you.- No option for adjusting the scope.- No way to tell how much is your bullet drop if everyone is firing. Good Luck- Your teammate is always dumb as hell+ Alright experience in long range combat. + There is bullet drop.+ Pretty nice voice actingTo be honest, if this is a indie game, it is pretty nice and alright.

Here are the reasons why it is so annoying to play this game.1. Resource Management Gameplay: For me I have no idea this is a game that manage different kind of stuff. I thought this is just a typical VN game. I played in both normal mode and waifu mode (Easiest mode, it says you won't fail in this mode but I still got a bad end :/). It just feels like really repetitive and frustration simply because the difficulty is so hard in normal mode that I can't even survive through the first month. Also even you are in Waifu mode, clicking the same buttons over and over again is not that fun for a visual novel. :(2. No backlog: I personally think that backlog is really important for a VN game, especially when it is a PAID game. It is pretty annoying when you just misclicked once and skipped a dialog, this happens quite often and there is no way you can get back and read the conversation.3. Bugs: This is not a really big problem but sometimes the order of the events is messed up. For example in the Storage Room event, where the order of appology and explaination always changed everytime I load it.4. UI, really minor stuff but the UI doesn't look polished and clean.Short list for Good things about this game:+ Opening Songs+ Really lovely art + Professional music+ Reasonable Story Good for me is I bought this at sale so not a big deal, but for the people who bought it outside sales, bad luck.[Edit]After this post, I have found out the way to skip to different scenes. Although it is kind of annoying to do so, I will still probably do it because it is really fruastrating to start over again and the fact that I may get a bad end again. However, it is still really sad to me that I can't complete the game in a normal way, I really hope the dev can shorten the gameplay and also decrease the difficulty in the same time.

Well, disappointed me as expected. For the people wonder why this game is so sh!t, the reason is not because of pay to win, there is no pay2win. The reason is this game is not fun anymore. What this game was:- Tactical battles- Really rely on how you build the bots- Chaotic battle (12 vs 12)- Type and CPU based matchmaking- Progressing into higher tier is so fun.- Choosing the parts you want to unlock as the game progress- No MOBA element whatsoever.- There is actual SKILL to learn.What this game is now:- Luck-based matchmaking because the dev want more impatiences players wanting for fast-pace gameplay.- No tactical battle whatsoever. Just try to rush to the capture points with your teammate and use some op weapons- The way of building your robot doesn't matter anymore. It will be destroyed within a split second anyway.- The only way to get into (12 vs 12) battle is to meet the ""requirements"" (Brawl mode) and the requirements changes every week.- Want to buy something you want? You need to click like 20 times to sell all your stuff and ""forge"" it. Because ""CRATES""- They are trying to change this game into an arcade-moba game.

Ya boi has already killed a dragon I met in a tavern, 2 beholders, a bunch of rakshashas and is currently busy trying to reseal some demon on the bottom floor of some 9 tiered murder house. The side quests don't even feel like side quests in the traditional sense with respect to DOSII and BGIII which have much more guided and linear storylines (even with their large areas to explore between parts). Like 1 hr in and having just left Irenicus' kink dungeon, I finally can go to the town gates to explore outside the city, but lo and behold during a quick stop in the tavern to rest, I discover a secret hole behind some random wall and get annihilated by some lich with timestop and immunity to all my spells, magical and normal weapons.This game is excellent and although clearly dated in some respects (e.g. graphics), it has managed to perfectly recreate the very essence of playing D&D with a group, with new quests and hooks every session and things to discover and delve into in even the most mundane of areas. High level gameplay is an added bonus. My only real gripe (admittedly mostly my own fault) is that I have only ever played 5e and 1e pathfinder so I'm not too familiar with the intricacies of AD&D such as calculation of saving throws and class levelling.

Coming from the original CoH and the DoW series, this game has really taken the best parts of the previous generation of entries and improved on them significantly while preserving the essence of the franchise. I was pleasantly surprised to find the factions intuitive and very similar to their CoH counterparts yet at the same time the huge range of doctrines provides a thematic and varied gameplay experience which really allows you develop to your own style.Whether you prefer bone crushing armoured spearheads, a blitz of infantry supported by aerial bombing runs or heavily fortified forward artillery bases, there is most definitely a permutation of doctrine and faction that will satisfy your inner history buff.In my 3rd ever game I ended up encircled on a central hill after the soviet horde had pushed my allies back through the forests on both sides. After weathering masses of T34/76s and SU-85s with a couple of manned AT guns and infantry with heavy losses from sustained 120mm mortar fire I managed to scavenge enough fuel to call a King Tiger to break the enemy lines behind, allowing me to recapture a vital point thus reconnecting my forward base and allowing me to reinforce my decimated squads.

1718,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198164619567/recommended/,Other,1,Recommended,1,0,"Thoroughly recommend this game with some major pointers.1. This is best played as a single player game; however, multiplayer is enjoyable with some conditions.2. The DLC are ESSENTIAL to the full experience (I cannot repeat this enough) and only 1 player requires DLC for multiplayer.3. Games are long; 1-3 hrs (even when actively trying to expedite the experience).4. Very easy to learn.Prior to purchase I‚Äôd never heard of the original board game and it was gifted to me for multiplayer by another newcomer to the game. I‚Äôve never played online, and mostly play with the City, Dungeon, Highland, Woodland, Reaper, Sacred Pool and Deep Realms expansions enabled while also sometimes using the Cataclysm, Clockwork Kingdom, Frostmarch, Realm of Souls and Dragon expansions.Talisman is a highly strategic game revolving around probability while providing a dungeon crawling/ classic RPG adventuring atmosphere. Essentially, players take turns rolling a d6 to move either direction round a map, landing on spaces which cause various things to happen. This could be battling a monster, finding gear, or attaining new perks. All these experiences are condensed into a single deck you draw from, thus randomising encounters. The DLC add additions to the main map that you can travel around, each with their own decks of encounters. Other DLCs add cards to the pre-existing deck, increasing the range of encounters based around the same theme. Off of my own experience, much of the strategy involves mitigation and giving yourself more options in a game where almost everything is determined by the random outcome of a d6. Examples include replacing unfavourable encounters (Prophetess, Orb of Knowledge, Fez, Stompy), manipulating movement (Amazon, Trailblazer, Walking Stick, Dreadwing, Clockwork Owl, Teleport, Poltergeist), rerolling dice (Lucky, Fang, Token of Fate, destinies, evil characters with high starting fate), manipulating battles (Martyr, Soul Shatter, Bounty Hunter), spellcasting (generally gives you things to do during your turn)  and ultimately protecting yourself from things that can really screw you (Lugh's Cloak, Bag of Holding, Counterspell, Lucky Coin, Nuadu's Torc, going for less risky plays). In addition, certain things can carry over after death (dragon scales, destinies, quest rewards) meaning that you can plan even in that respect.The sheer number of possibilities (with the DLC) means that many long term and spur of the moment combos are possible and yet every space, card and character is clearly explained when you land on or draw it meaning that even the newest of players can play within a few minutes. The automation of gameplay also makes it more accessible and is well done although the casting windows and queuing of spells requires a bit of getting used to. Whenever I have thought that something is not working, it is usually because I have not read the card carefully and I am genuinely not able to use it for some reason. Sometimes this specific wording means that certain objects are far more powerful than they first appear (e.g. Arnkell, Lucky Coin).There is far too much to cover everything else, but I will attempt to briefly address my original pointers together with pros and cons frequently brought up by other reviewers.Cons often brought up (incl. in the Metacritic reviews)1.	Randomness ‚Ä?as stated before, I do believe that there is strategy involved with fiddling probability. For example, the prophetess‚Ä?ability allows me to replace encounters but ultimately the player chooses how much they want to push their luck. Also, many combos/plays only require 2 or even 1 card. Finally, knowledge of the differences in regions of the map can allow you to farm in areas which are more suited for your character like choosing to focus on encountering red scales as a high strength character. 2.	Unbalanced characters ‚Ä?there is no doubt that this is true. To counterbalance, I enjoy having players choose from 3 random characters and then reselecting if they die. This feels like it balances things out and makes it more fun with both AI and human players - you don‚Äôt feel stuck with a bad character and equally stronger ones can be killed. I would like to note that while spellcasting characters are strong, I don‚Äôt find them to be horrifically broken when you have selected more DLC. With all the extra spells added, I find that their spellcasting ability becomes more balanced and muted with cycling also being less effective.3.	Games take too long ‚Ä?completely agree with this. I usually play against AI and keep jumping to the next human unless I want to queue a spell or do something else. Via this method, I don‚Äôt think this negatively affects gameplay. However of course this can‚Äôt be done in multiplayer and hence why I find this game is most enjoyable in single player when and if you‚Äôre playing purely for the strategy aspect. If you do play multiplayer, I would certainly recommend capping the turns or choosing a faster ending, especially if not all players will be available for a 3-hour game. 4.	Season pass doesn‚Äôt include newer all DLC as promised/game is expensive especially as you need the DLC ‚Ä?As I got the game quite recently this issue was a bit before my time. As a result, I can understand why other people are frustrated, but from my own perspective and also addressing the second part about price, grabbing all DLC and the base game while on a minor sale for around ¬£30 seemed reasonable which I assume most people would do. I wouldn‚Äôt get the DLC for the regular price. 5.	AI get better rolls ‚Ä?maybe but if true is very subtle. At the same time, it could be me only noticing the times I really get screwed over whereas I never notice when other players/the AI get screwed. 6.	AI is bad ‚Ä?The AI will inevitably have a disadvantage no matter what they do. On the other hand, the AI does seem to optimise for the most part and if you want to make it more of a challenge you can always play against more at once or give them better characters.7.	Clunky UI ‚ÄìThe majority of things are clearly explained especially with regards to space and card effects and options are shown clearly, both during your turn and other people‚Äôs turns. That said, some things are unintuitive, like spell casting timings. Any newcomers could be at quite a disadvantage here against the AI or more experienced players, and easily may not realise solutions without outside help.8.	Not much replayability once you‚Äôve seen all the cards several times ‚Ä?I‚Äôd disagree with this since you can play so may characters and swap out so many DLC. In addition, that knowledge of the array of cards that appear in certain areas is essential to planning out your strategy as you get better. Again, though, this is quite dependant on buying the DLCs. With just the base game the cards and scenarios will feel repetitive.9.	Unsocial compared to the board game ‚Ä?Subjective, to a large extent I agree that much of the idle banter you get between players while it isn‚Äôt their turn is lost. It feels like a much longer gap between turns sitting in front of a screen. This is one of the reasons I feel that it is better as a single player game. Might work for some not for others.10.	Bugs/crashes ‚Ä?the only crash I have experienced is where the game freezes, but this doesn‚Äôt happen too often, and the game automatically saves for me. It‚Äôs so fast to close and reopen that I usually don‚Äôt mind, though it is an inconvenience.Overall:From my perspective the digital version has offered me a taste of what so many love about the original cult classic at a FRACTION of the price while also providing me with hours of single player fun. It is an easy way to become familiar with the rules, strategies and try out the expansions before you get the real base game for ¬£30 (not including the expansions which are ¬£10 each). I would certainly consider this game a good port and a great entry for the physical game.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/247000,"15 July, 2020",301.5,104.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Die Freiheit alles zu tun ist Segen und Fluch zugleich, denn leider ist der rote Faden nicht unbedingt erkennbar. Was die Mainstory anbelangt, weiss ich nach 10 Stunden nicht genau, was ich eigentlich zu tun habe.

I've also played this game a lot. Trust me, the longer you play it, the more you discover it really is just trash. Never ending pop-ups to the catcher...so many other things just as improbable and every bit as irritating. So, for SMB2, the devs claim to have addressed some of the issues like the ridiculous number of pop-ups to the catcher, but they add PROCs that include player injuries? Neither is desirable as an actual feature of the game. It's like replacing one thing with something that is equivalent, but then for SMB2 they want $30. Okay, apparently the devs need some clarity, so listen and get this straight. Your game essentially fills the role of an arcade baseball game. It has some sim elements that actually add to the game, but basically just seasons and some elements of team development. SMB1 the team development is a horrible grind. I should get SMB2 for free after SMB1 garbage. Your game fills the arcade baseball genre roll, and the only reason it has enjoyed any success is because there simply lacks a decent game to fill it's place.The devs want a somewhat realisitic physics-based experience, realisitic baseball, horrible interface, attempt to add in too many sim elements...ultimately the game is junk. I've felt this way and essentially hated the game the entire time I've played it. I'm writing a review now because I hear what they claim to have improved in the new version and there is no way in hell it's worth $30. Devs either need to learn more about baseball or more about how to make an enjoyable game that doesn't try to [awkardly] fit in multiple genres. My assumption, you sat the bench in little league and cried on the way home like the stupid animations in this game. How in the hell can you have pitchers throwing 100+mph and think it's reasonable to have crying animation? Do you know how annoying that ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• is?

A bit of Sid Meier's Civ and Banished meshed together, set in a Norse mythology atmosphere of sorts.There is room for improvement, but with 50 hours of playtime under my belt, I would say that I still have quite a bit of work to master the strengths of each clan and how to successfully win in each possible way.From the outset, it seems that Wisdom and Trade victories are a bit ""overpowered"" (perhaps a bit unbalanced). I can't say this with certainty until I have more hours played. Depending on the clan you choose, there are different approaches. To truly evaluate the game, many playthroughs are necessary.Despite this, it is my impression that there is a slight lack of balance, and possibly a lack of depth. This will not likely deter you from playing many hours, and I believe improvements will be coming along nicely while in early access.One point to mention; I would hope to see a more gradual transition going into and out of winter. It isn't a terrible issue, but one that I would prefer to be improved upon. Tl;drGreat game, particularly while still in early access. Pleasant graphics, relaxing game, can be easy or reasonably challenging in single-player. I have not tried multiplayer yet. I see potential for very many hours of play.

You can earn money to spend in an upgrade shop (the Artillery, where you buy ""abilities""), but you have to grind out guessing games to earn the money. Whereas this is obviously a Battleship style game (obvious even before you purchase the game), what you don't know ahead of time is how unbalanced it is. By the third mission of the main campaign, you have 2 mortars in a 6x6 grid. The mortars take up one block each, so you can only take 2 hits and then you lose. The AI has more than 6 blocks of units in a 6x6 grid, and the game gives you no idea how many the AI has at the beginning of each mission. I haven't made it past the third mission of the main campaign (as of this review) because this is just a pitiful waste of my time when I could be watching paint dry instead.The AI also has ""abilities"" to hit multiple blocks, whereas you are stuck with grinding to buy lesser abilities early in the game, and they are really expensive and underpowered, particularly when the AI has some ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• that can hit like 5 blocks at once as well as at least one airstrike (which hits 2 blocks) by this third mission. You can use radar and airstrike abilities if you have purchased them at this point, but they are very expensive. When I say expensive I mean you will grind out clicking on grids trying to win missions in order to gain money. There are side-missions in which you can gain money, but the clicking and guessing is just horribly boring. In the game Battleship it's essentially the same, except you know what you're up against (the same units as you have, and there is a little more fun to the minimal planning and some strategy involved even though it amounts to guessing).This is just a poorly thought out game. Nobody likes an unbalanced guessing-game. There are people that pop up with irritating dialog as well, which just makes it even more annoying because that makes more clicks to grind out.

The objective of the game is very simple; destroy enemy tanks and don't die. The concept is simple, but the game presents a reasonable challenge. The AI is a quite accurate shot, and you must be as well in order to succeed. In terms of graphics, textures are very plain. Shading is nice and, together, this enhances the tight, solid feel of the game. Very nice particle effects and pounding explosions seem to justify the otherwise simplistic appearance. The contrast is satisfying. Controls are pretty good and feel tight as well. Currently there is no controller support and no multiplayer game mode.

If you attempt to travel much beyond where you begin, you get a message stating ""this area is unavailable in Alpha"", which is akin to the ""under construction"" message occasionally encountered on websites.

Game should explain its systems (mainly stealth and reputation) better because they're not always that realistic/expected.Some notes for the developers that I hope they'll address in sequel/future:  - Unnecessary clutter collisions where horse get stuck on small height deltas (e.g. stones, knee high fences). - Looted arrows not stacking properly (workaround: move arrows to horse and back to player inventory). - NPCs still detecting you when you're behind. They appear to have a hidden ""detection gauge"" but it isn't indicated in any way. - Reputation seems to decrease after you sleep, even if no one saw you commit a crime from before. - NPC chatter spam repeating the same lines over and over. - Combat is very RNG where ""stronger"" enemies just counter or dodge your attacks about 70% of the time. - Slow-mo in melee combat happens too often and just looks weird/off-key. - No indication of when timed quests will fail in the journal.

If you're familiar with Javascript or any programming language, you'll have a lot of fun optimizing your scripts and improving your technique as you go through the game. Bitburner also continues to offer more challenges and new tidbits of information to keep you interested and engaged throughout. Although I will point out that once you reach a certain threshold of automation and progress, the game seems to shift a lot more to the side of ""just wait a long time"" versus ""optimize everything."" I personally enjoyed the latter part a lot, thinking up strategies for optimally leeching off of the various servers and improving your scripts, making new tools to give you more information, etc... However after playing for a decent bit, I have most of everything automated and scripted and even the ""new game plus"" modes, as it were, just seem to grind everything to a halt even more. In conclusion, I definitely recommend it, and it's a ton of fun when you start out. However once you get to a certain point, the game just grinds down and stops giving that fun optimization feel that you get when starting out.

Some levels will have you breaking your brain about which combinations of switches use or which order of doors to open. While other levels require more precision platforming, timing your jumps correctly or being swift with your movement.Speaking of movement; the way you move in the game feels very smooth. Everything from using your abilities to simply moving around and interacting with the world goes without a hitch. Especially when you need to be precise, this really makes the experience pop and truly lets the game come alive.The combination of those factors make for a very entertaining experience. But the game also delivers plenty when it comes to the soundtrack, which is great to play along to. Each level has a unique soundtrack (at least so far) and they're all perfectly suited to the environment the game takes place in. And there's plenty of levels to keep you entertained. There's multiple hidden levels that you have to unlock by retrieving secrets and if that's not enough, you can even start speed running the game and trying to beat your past time on each level!The entire game just oozes polish, from the visuals, to the sound design, to the amount of content you get. I would've gladly paid $10 for this, but as it stands, the developer is mental and decided to release this for free. There is plenty of games that are going for over $10 right now with less content and less polish than you get with Revisitor. I highly recommend you give it a try if you're even a little into puzzling and/or platforming and guarantee you'll have a great time with it!

Most of the UI is literally a box with a color and a symbol, the hint text in the loading screen is often barely readable because it's white on a light background, most buttons are never explained and even if they have a tooltip it doesn't explain what it does half the time. It even starts before the game is loaded, when you select your resolution, graphical settings and language, which looks like an interface purely meant during testing for the developer. To create new stuff you've gotta navigate multiple tiered lists that then often have more objects hidden inside them, which you have to just stumble across. When editing properties there are numerous sliders that again are hidden behind layers of menu's, without proper explanations, tutorials or even tooltips.The list goes on and on. If the developer would either hire a designer or put some actual effort into the UI it might be a really fun and relaxing experience. However as it stands, it's like playing Dark Souls using 2 bananas and an orange peel for controllers. You can see there's some real fun to be had, but you're just constantly struggling with the way to interact with all that fun.

If you take that on board you'll have more fun!I really like JC3 although it does have flaws. The wingsuit is amazing, exploring the map is an enjoyable experience and experimenting with the mechics is endlessly hilarious. There's plenty of things to do and I found the game easily ate up 50+ hrs while liberating all the settlements, completing the storyline and getting all the collectables.Once you've done all that you're kinda left to your own devices. Unless you actively enjoy experimenting with the mechanics of the game, or happen to enjoy stunts there's not an awful lot left to do. You can reinstate individual locations and liberate them again but it's a little bit of an empty process with no goal. As a single player open world game this is a huge mistake not to add some kind of value to the game after it has been completed (DLC is on it's way but we don't have any idea of what content it will provide yet)This is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to flaws. There's design decisions that leave me baffled: no FOV slider or choice of camera angles (I think they ran out of control pad buttons to use lol), assigning boost to different buttons depending on the type of vehicle you're in. The weird delay you get between stunt jumping on a vehicle and being able to grapple. The main island being virtually empty. The dumb AI. The crashing. The list goes on and on. The lack of keybindings. Jeez I could talk about the flaws for a LONG time as there are so many and they really do effect the expereince negatively.Having said all that, I'm a huge fan of the Just CAuse franchise and the possibilities the game yields. As such I'm ok with overlooking the flaws. I spend a lot of my time stunting or creating silly experiments in JC3 and it's easily been worth the money paid. Will you enjoy it as much? I'm not sure... I suppose it depends how you play games. If you follow the missions and complete the story before moving on you may miss a lot about what makes JC3 so unique and enjoyable. However if you're more creative with your gameplay then you'll likely get a lot more from the experience.Either way I'm looking to the future now as the DLC shall be here soon (hopefully with more map content) and the JC2MP Team are working on a multiplayer mod for Just Cause 3.... which will change EVERYTHING!

I've played with friends experimenting with the grapple and laughed my head off. I've arranged Destruction Derby that were so successful the developers made a gamemode out of it. I've participated in some of the biggest, most insane mass racing, skydiving and faction wars I've ever witnessed in a game. I've performed solo and combination stunts with friends while co-ordinating over voice chat. I've went on a kill spee with my trusty sniper rifle and noscpoe killed hundred of enemies (other players at the airport).It truely is an amazing game with almost no limitations: the biggest is probably your imagination.If you thought Just Cause 2 was good then you're gonna be blown away by the multiplayer with 100+ players on a server.

I've also enjoyed Shenmue, Dragon Quest, Bully, Fallout, Farcry, Spiderman, Burnout, Arkham City..... any genre, any platform- it's easily my favourite type of gameworld. But the mechanics make a game and Just Cause 2 has the most fun mechanics I've ever played with. The possibilities are only limited to your imagination....... and skill.......Wanna steal a fighterjet? Cool, Rico can do that. Wanna fly that plane toward a bridge, jump on top and surf the jet under the bridge? Fine, Rico can do that. Wanna jump from a building flying through death defying gaps and before hitting the ground, release your parachute and walk away unharmed? Rico can do that one too. Really, once you get the hang of the controls the game comes to life in a way I've experienced in no other.......That would be my recommendation over if it wasn't for one final thing. Just Cause 2 Multiplayer. It's exactly what it sounds like and so much more. This is a mod that allows over 2000 players to join a single server, playing together on the same map. Nobody should allow themselves to ignore the fact that this really is a landmark in gaming. Never has a game of action orientated 3rd person shooting/jumping/driving been played on this scale.
