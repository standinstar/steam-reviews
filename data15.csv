Parsec is an app that streams the game at much better quality than steam remote play with a ton of settings.

To me, the most noticeable early access thing are some minor graphical bugs here and there, performance issues and a lack of content.

I have a lot to talk about so I will dive right into it.First of all, the game looks great.

As opposed to some people in here I thought the story was pretty good, but BUTSPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT! SPOILER ALERT!Two things:One, Maya's death was a waste. Considering she was the siren class in Borderlands 2 and a very cool character, they killed her off way too early in the game, and the death scene was not even that great.Secondly Ava is just a straight up dislikable character. You can't change my mind.Minor complaint: Lilith I have a name, stop calling me ""killer"".Enough complaining, this game is great.

The game forces you to download all of its 50-60GB through a 3rd party launcher, meaning that download time counts towards playtime. This means that you can't get a refund through Steam since you've most likely passed the 2-hour mark. 2. It's a torrent download. Ew.3. The Lieutenant, Sergeant, and Major packs are a scam. At the moment, there is no way to activate them. The website to activate your items has been down since release.4. The servers go down pretty often and yesterday many people, including me, were experiencing matchmaking issues making us unable to play.Now, what about the actual game?It's decent. Gameplay is pretty fun, it looks nice and there's a decent amount of customization as well. However, the game does have its own issues. - The progression is extremely slow. It has become your standard grindy F2P game. - Even though I meet the recommended requirements, performance in normal battles hasn't been great. It barely runs at 60 FPS (usually in the high 50s, low 60s) on lowest settings. Performance gets a lot better in TDM where I easily get over 100 FPS, but it still doesn't feel ""fluid"". I can't really explain it, but it feels like the game is running at 60 Hz even though I have a 144 Hz monitor (I could be wrong here, my brain could just be deceiving me).- The spawns in TDM are terrible, a lot of the time you spawn in front of an enemy with no spawn protection essentially becming a free kill.I wanted to like this game, I really did, but in it's current state it's pretty hard to recommend.

As far as I used to play Fortress Mu, I aleady had a profile, unfortunitely there was practically no way to reset the password, as far as it spew out that my e-mail doesn't exist, but when I pressed on register, it spew out that the e-mail is already in use... Webzen, do you even Database?!?! Eventually, after many attempts, I did manage to recover my account.Anyway, upon starting the game, I realised there is no controls page, so, on slower computers you actually need to get into the map with a created character, to change the settings, which might cause huge issues for many. Second of all, game is just utterly buggy - if you spend too much time in the character creation screen, your session times out and you're basically stuck in the menu, ""back"" button doesn't work and ""Create Character"" doesn't work either, so the only way to progress is by restarting the game. Afterwards, when you get into the actual playable area, you instantly get like level 100 with max stats, had a pretty fancy character gotta say, anyway, I also got 2 quests, to kill some enemies and to meet some dude. I couldn't find a way to interact with the NPCs (tapping on them does nothing), aswell, monsters, that I was supposed to kill, were just frozen, you couldn't harm them, neither would they attempt to harm you. Gate to the next area was locked down... In short, you're basically stuck in a 10 metres small room, unable to do anything.

But that aside, this is a nice game! The best part about it in my opinion is the fact is has 3 campaigns: Marine, Alien (Xenomorph) and Predator. Let's start off with the marine campaign:In the Marine campaign you play as Rookie (what a surprise) who's squad is killed in a Xenomorph ambush. Basicly, you're on your own for the biggest part of the campaign. You will find other marines from time to time, but they usually don't last very long. It is a funny campaign since you have 3 'boss fights' in it: The Xenomorph Queen (ironicly the first and easiest one), the battle with the Predator and the battle with Wayland. There are some different weapons you can choose but for the most part it's a general FPS with the addition of aliens and the motion tracker.In the Alien campaign you play as Specimen 6, one of the colony's guinea pig Xenomorphs. Unlike the 2001 version of this game, you start immediately as a fully grown Xenomorph. Your goal is to break out and kill humans, and eventually predators. Very cool campaign, unfortunately it's the smallest one. The fact you can walk on any surface is also nice, and the stealth kills and finishing moves are both amazing and gory. Be aware of the androids btw, they're very dangerous...Finally in the Predator campaign you have to hunt down the Abomination (it's basicly a Predalien). To do this, the Predator has an awesome variaty of weapons at it's disposal. The plasma rifle is overpowered, the mines are too, the smart disk can be difficult to handle with fast moving targets and the spear as well. The cloacking, stealth and the different visions really add to the feeling of the predator campaign. Once again the stealth kills and finishing moves are both amazing and gory.There's also a multiplayer in the game with many gamemodes that barely anyone plays. Seriously, 95% of the games are Team Deathmatch or Mixed Team Deathmatch. They are fun, don't get me wrong, but it can be repetative to do the whole time. Also by playing matches you can level up and unlock new skins for your Marine, Alien or Predator.All in all, very good game, nice graphics and lovely 3 different campaigns. Get this game if you enjoy the different play styles it offers or if you just love the Alien and Predator universe! :)P.S.

I'll be honest, once they released the game, it wasn't done. The AI was terrible, which was in my opinion the worst of all. However, now that Emperor Edition is out, most if not all the nasty bugs and glitches are gone. If you want to change various things in the game you specificly don't like, the community got you covered. There's a huge amount of mods out there to create the total war you like to play. Or just play the vanilla version :P  Anyway, the historical accuracy (or authenticity, right Ella ;P) is good, the battles are intense and Rome is mother to us all! (sorry, had to do that :P)P.S. A slight dislike is the price. Not only for the game, but also for the DLC's.

It is different than RO2, but by its core its still pretty much the same game. This game is more fast phase than RO2.For the people who are not familiar with RO2 let me explain this game a bit.Its a FPS shooter game that takes place in Vietnam during the Vietnam war.In this game you have 3 different time periods: early, mid and late war. Each period provides different weapons, armies and support.North Vietnam has a choice between 2 armies while South Vietnam has 4 (in late war only 1). Each army will provide you with different weapons.There are also different roles between both factions, but at its roots they are almost the same. Like one has RPG and other has grenadier. If you are new then don't go as the commander and squad leader. You cant take commander role unless you have hit the level requirements, but still leave it for a bit more experienced players since you can win a lot easier with a good commander. Just watch and learn until you feel ready enough to try out. Squad leaders are just a mobile spawn point units for South Vietnam while for North Vietnam they make tunnels (spawn points). If you are good at not dying be sure to go as the squad leader.This game combines tactics with fun very well. It is semi realistic. Similar to RO2 each hit can be super deadly, but in this game getting killed from 1 shot is not as often. I strongly suggest this game to any FPS tactical game fan.
