However its still a GTA game and the story alone is one of the best ive ever played Single Player wise and the multiplayer at its best was really fun so its a bit of a gamble if you intend to start in 2019 : Modders and all that crap on top of the connection issuesId give it a 9.7/10 Single Player    and  4~6 /10 Muliplayer								,https://steamcommunity.com/app/271590,"9 July, 2019",130.2,337.3

EARLY ACESS GAME wich even isnt propperly running on ANY PC(including my machine 2 tb SSD, 16GB RAM, 4gb GEFORCE980 GT ) and my buddies (nearly same setup)  with acceptable performance. sry i am not this rich to afford an NASA computer. instead of fixing and optimizing they are releasing almost every week an new update with tons of dinos and WITHOUT fixing any bugs.  and now they released an DLC wich costs nearly the same price (27‚Ç¨) as i payed for the early access FULL GAME. dont support studio wildcard ! i would apreciate an refound for ARK if it was possible....AND PLUS i recordnized the full Early access game PLUS the scoched scam are about 18 euros and if i am OWNING THE GAME AND WANT TO GET THIS F**** DLC I SHOULD PAY 27‚Ç¨?

Bu arada Origins de bir Arkham oyunu olmasƒ±na raƒümen, serinin ge√ßmi≈üini konu aldƒ±ƒüƒ± i√ßin √º√ßlemenin bir par√ßasƒ± deƒüil. Daha √ßok bir yan oyundu. Ama konumuz Arkham Knight, o y√ºzden incelemeye ge√ßiyorum.Joker'in √∂l√ºm√ºnden sonra Gotham'da ortalƒ±k durulmu≈ütur ama bu fƒ±rtƒ±na √∂ncesi sessizlikten ba≈üka bir ≈üey deƒüildir elbette. Scarecrow Asylum'dan sonra ortadan kaybolmu≈ütu ve kendisi bu oyunda ana d√º≈ümanƒ±mƒ±z olarak geri d√∂ner. Scarecrow bir restorana yeni korku gazƒ±nƒ± salarak t√ºm Gotham'ƒ± tehdit eder. Halk panikler ve ≈üehir bo≈üaltƒ±lƒ±r. Gotham'ƒ±n sokaklarƒ± bir kez daha haydutlarƒ±n ve g√º√ßl√º su√ßlularƒ±n olmu≈ütur. Ama ne Batman ne de GCPD (Gotham City Polis Merkezi) ≈üehri su√ßlulara terk etmeyecektir. Ama tabi ki y√ºk√ºn b√ºy√ºk kƒ±smƒ± Batman'in sƒ±rtƒ±ndadƒ±r.Scarecrow'u arayƒ±p, onu bulmak tabi ki kolay olmayacak. Arkham Knight isimli gizemli bir karakter ortaya √ßƒ±kar ve Batman'i √∂ld√ºrmekle tehdit eder. Batman gibi g√º√ßl√º bir d√∂v√º≈ü√ß√ºd√ºr ve Batman'in t√ºm hareketlerini bilmektir. Bu olduk√ßa uzun bir gece olacaktƒ±r. Oyunun senaryo kƒ±smƒ±nƒ± spoilersƒ±z b√∂yle √∂zetleyebilirim. Olduk√ßa g√ºzel sekanslarƒ± olan, ba≈üƒ±ndan sonuna kadar s√ºr√ºkleyici olmu≈ü.Peki oyunda kimler var? Batman'i ve Gotham ≈üehrini sevenleri tatmin edecek kadar √ºnl√º y√ºz var. Penguen, Two-Face, Mad Hatter, Killer-Croc, Azrael, Deathstroke, Ras, gƒ±cƒ±klƒ±ƒüƒ±n efendisi Riddler ve √ßok daha fazlasƒ± oyunda kar≈üƒ±mƒ±za √ßƒ±kƒ±yorlar. Oyun i√ßerik olarak olduk√ßa tatmin ediyor sizi. Oyunda Joker de var ama kendisi √∂ld√ºƒü√º i√ßin onu √ßok daha farklƒ± bir ≈üekilde g√∂r√ºyoruz. Ama Joker'in bu oyunda kullanƒ±mƒ± cidden muazzam. Sizi bir an olsun yalnƒ±z bƒ±rakmƒ±yor ve g√ºzel esprileriyle oyun keyfinizi artƒ±rƒ±yor. Mark Hamill ve Kevin Conroy yine √ßok ama √ßok muazzamlar, seslendirmelerde m√ºthi≈ü i≈ü √ßƒ±kartmƒ±≈ülar.Gelelim Arkham Knight'ƒ± serinin diƒüer oyunlarƒ±ndan ayƒ±ran yeniliklere. Neler yeni?√ñncelikle d√∂v√º≈ü ve gizlilik mekanikleri. Arkham serisi d√∂v√º≈ü mekaniklerinde zaten muazzam i≈ü √ßƒ±kartmƒ±≈ü bir seriydi. D√∂v√º≈ü mekanikleri bu oyunda ar≈üa √ßƒ±kmƒ±≈ü. Combo yapmak √ßok daha kolay. Ayrƒ±ca oyuna bazƒ± yeni d√º≈üman tipleri eklenmi≈ü ve bunlar sizi aletlerinizi d√∂v√º≈ülerde daha √ßok kullanmaya itiyor. √ñrnek vermek gerekirse ≈üoklu kƒ±yafet giyen bir d√º≈üman tipi var, bunlara vurduƒüunuzda hasar alƒ±yorsunuz. Bunlarƒ± ≈üok tabancanƒ±zla vurmanƒ±z gerekiyor √∂nce. Ya da taramalƒ± silahla gezen ayƒ±lar var, bunlarƒ± counter ataklarla indirmeniz gerekiyor. Ya da indirdiƒüiniz adamlarƒ± healleyip tekrar ayaƒüa kaldƒ±ran rescuerlar var, i≈üinizi zorla≈ütƒ±rmak i√ßin buradalar. Ama hi√ßbiri Batman i√ßin bir tehdit deƒüil √ß√ºnk√º o Batman.Gizlilik mekaniklerine de yeni ≈üeyler eklenmi≈ü. Birini heykelin √ºzerinden aldƒ±ƒüƒ±nƒ±zda, heykelde asƒ±lƒ± kalƒ±yordu. Artƒ±k diƒüer adamlar heykelden indirip kurtarmayƒ± deniyorlar ama nafile tabi. Ya da Fear Attack'a ne demeli? Zincirleme saldƒ±rƒ± ile 4 5 adamƒ± birden indirme yeteneƒüiniz var artƒ±k ama doƒüru sƒ±ra ile indirmeniz lazƒ±m. En √ßok ho≈üuma giden ses deƒüi≈ütirme aleti. Batman artƒ±k d√º≈ümanlarƒ±nƒ±n seslerini taklit eden bir cihaza sahip, bunu kullanarak alandaki adamlarƒ±n kafasƒ±nƒ± karƒ±≈ütƒ±rabilir, onlarƒ± kuytuya √ßekip gizlice indirebilirsiniz. Batman olma hissiyatƒ±nƒ±zƒ± ar≈üa √ßƒ±kartmƒ±≈ülar.Bunun dƒ±≈üƒ±nda oyundaki en b√ºy√ºk yenilik Bat-Mobil. Oyunda √ßok ama √ßok kullanmƒ±≈ülar. Kullanƒ±mƒ± rahat, ≈üehirde √ßarptƒ±ƒüƒ± yeri par√ßalayacak kadar g√º√ßl√º. Eƒülenceli de bir mekanik olmu≈ü. Sƒ±rf Bat-Mobil i√ßin bile tonla d√º≈üman tasarlamƒ±≈ülar. Bazen oluk oluk gelen tank g√º√ßleri sƒ±ksa da ben genel olarak Bat-Mobil'i kullanmaktan √ßok eƒülendim.Oyunun Season Pass i√ßeriƒüi de √ßok dolu, o y√ºzden almanƒ±zƒ± tavsiye ederim. Eƒüer alƒ±rsanƒ±z ≈üu i√ßerikler a√ßƒ±lƒ±yor: Ana hikayede Ra's, Killer-Croc, Mr. Freeze ve Mad Hatter. Buna ek olarak Arkham Episodes diye bir kƒ±sƒ±m var ve 6 ayrƒ± hikayede ≈üu karakterleri y√∂netiyorsunuz. Her biri kƒ±sa ve farklƒ± hikayeler: Nightwing, Robin, Jason Todd, Cat Woman, Harley Quinn ve BatgirlSon olarak teknik kƒ±sƒ±mlara deƒüinmek istiyorum. Oyunun grafikleri muazzam, bence bug√ºn gibi ta≈ü gibi g√∂z√ºk√ºyorlar. Daha ge√ßen g√ºn √ßƒ±kan Far Cry 6'dan daha g√ºzel g√∂z√ºk√ºyor. Gotham'ƒ±n atmosferi ≈üahane, zaten ≈üehirlerin gece atmosferlerine bayƒ±lƒ±yorum. Gotham da bu atmosferin hakkƒ±nƒ± fazlasƒ±yla veren bir ≈üehir olmu≈ü. G√ºzel tasarlamƒ±≈ülar. M√ºzikler de atmosferi besliyorlar fazlasƒ±yla. Oyunun √ßƒ±kƒ±≈ü d√∂nemindeki optimizasyon problemlerinden eser kalmadƒ±ƒüƒ±na g√∂re Arkham Knight kesinlikle oynanmayƒ± hak eden bir oyun oluyor.87/100								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/208650,"16 October, 2021",66.1,66.1

So much has changed.Lots of folks on the Tarlach server are pretty helpful. At least it's one of the few free MMORPG's that isn't too heavily influenced on the P2W model.

Helps a lot with grinding shares and level upping.The only ending i DO NOT RECOMMEND is the Conquest ending. It's pretty, and i mean, pretty DEPRESSING. Make sure you get that out of the way so you can see the better endings.here are my only two complaints:Like the first Re;Birth, it lacks any 16:10 resolutions (only 16:9).The other complaint? Sometimes when you load into a dungeon, the game may unexpectedly crash.Also, if you like Nep Nep, you don't get to see her much until late in the game.

I found myself playing this game for hours!This game has so much to offer that makes you want to play it over and over again. From endless running gags, to unlockables (apart from DLC). The remake system really adds a nice twist to gameplay. Sure, some things can be a bit repetitive, and the difficulty may be a bit high in some parts, but it is well worth purchasing!My only complaint is that it lacks any 16:10-compatible resolutions, only 16:9.The anime and art is pretty good too.

I can definitely recommend buying without a discount for the stellar overall quality alone.Verdict: Very GoodRating Chart HereAn exceptionally well-crafted love letter that will hook you with its captivating locations, attention to detail and engaging gameplay. If we‚Äôll never have HL2 Ep.3, we can always have ADACA instead.Follow our Curator page, IndieGems for more detailed reviews.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2851074327In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingProtagonist Jessy Thorn is a felon who got sentenced to mandatory military service. After basic training, the cryogenic pod housing them malfunctions, keeping them in stasis for a great amount of time. A sketchy sawbones known only as Chops reanimates Jessy and heals them, throwing in a cybernetic arm for good measure too. Awakened on the surface of planet Adaca, you won‚Äôt have time to know much of what‚Äôs going on, since the police called an APB on you -  time to run.The entire story takes place on the planet, which became of prominent interest for various factions, including mercenary groups and cultists, due to the ‚ÄòExclusion Zone‚Äô; an anomalous area where the laws of physics and space-time don‚Äôt apply in the same way as other places, and said to house phenomenal sources of power. It‚Äôs apparent that Adaca suffered battles and struggles in the past, which also continue to the present day.ADACA blends direct narrative in the form of dialogues, documents and log files, with indirect storytelling that uses the environment as primer for the players to then interpret the events as they see fit. I wouldn‚Äôt say the story, characters or happenings are a masterpiece at any point, but ADACA does successfully convey the feelings of mystery, intrigue and struggle coherent with its setting.Exploration & PuzzlesIn the Campaign, you‚Äôll traverse linear levels that however have a good amount of secondary areas and secrets to find in a style similar to the one seen in the Half-Life series, to which ADACA is clearly heavily-inspired. Thanks to Jessy‚Äôs cyber-arm, equipped with a gravity gun, you‚Äôll be able to move most objects around and use them to reach other places, as a weapon, or place them in order to solve puzzles that often use physics as a focal point. There isn‚Äôt a huge amount of proper ‚Äòpuzzles‚Äô, rather ADACA proposes significant changes to the gameplay formula (for instance, sections without weapons, or focused on threat avoidance) to spice up the variety. Each of these sections is well-polished (minus a few), and breaks the main gameplay loop effectively.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2851074262Combat SystemFights play out in an FPS fashion, either alone or with the support of (mostly) immortal companions that act out of their own will. Jessy will carry three weapons: a sidearm and two main guns of any type, ranging from shotguns to grenade launchers, assault rifles and several more ‚Äòexotic‚Äô alien guns I can‚Äôt really classify in any genre. Fighting the mercenary, police, cultist or even anomalous forces feels engaging at all times due to several factors. Firstly, the environments feel dynamic thanks to the physics that animate everything from debris to enemy corpses. Secondly, enemy AI is particularly competent, fast, dead accurate (on harder difficulties) and has advanced behaviors like retreating to regroup, flanking, using grenades. Rushing and hustling will lead to a swift death, while careful positioning and wise use of assets will be keys to victory.The variety of foes is high, and keeps adding new threats or aggravating circumstances until the end of the campaign. An important part of combat is also your gravity gun, which can be used to steal weapons from enemy hands, throw props around for high damage, and pull out all sorts of stunts like picking up rockets in mid air to throw them back to their user - very fun indeed.Zone Patrol ModeThis standalone mode puts you in the shoes of a wholly-different protagonist enrolled in a PMC, with the duty of completing various missions for their contractors. Unlike the campaign, this mode proposes an open-world structure with a world divided in zones, some will be the same as the campaign, others worked or even new. The enemies encountered won‚Äôt differ, but spawn randomly in each area instead of being hand-placed. Your objectives will vary, but they will mostly be fetch quests that involve crossing many areas to find some vaguely-described object or person of interest.ZP introduces some new mechanics like a shop to improve your arsenal for each sortie, by finding artifacts on the surface, which can then be used as currency to buy new weapons, armor and upgrades. While this mechanic gives a sense of progression, it just bars you from the same weapons and accessories you already used in the campaign.First debatable decision: you can‚Äôt manually save, which is frustrating when you have to traverse enormous swathes of land to reach an objective and get killed in the process. Secondly, the random enemy spawns are tremendously unbalanced compared to the meager starting weapons you‚Äôll have. It evens out later on, alas the start is really painful.This mode tries to be a sort of ‚Äòhalf-roguelite‚Äô based on runs, a non-linear open world, and at the same time quest-driven but influenced by RNG. It feels like a mess overall, due to the dispersiveness and sheer obscurity of its goals. While it brings some unique weapons and locations to the table (not present in the campaign), it feels like generic filler most of the time. Perhaps finishing Chapter 3 for release instead of this half-baked shenanigan would have been wiser.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2851234681 ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1765780,20 August,7.9,7.9

The technical and game design issues make the experience frustrating and cumbersome most of the time. There are countless, significantly better top-down shooters you could invest your time into.Verdict: MediocreRating Chart HereDespite a promising realism-oriented foundation and some good ideas, REDSIDE ultimately falls into mediocrity because of its evident game design flaws, technical issues and generic story.Follow our Curator page, Summit Reviews, to see more high-quality reviews regularly.In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingYear 1996. In a (probably?) alternative reality, Finland is close to joining the still-standing Soviet Union because, and I quote, ‚Äúthe Finnish bourgeois class realized the beauty of comradeship in Communism‚Äù, thus massively altering the geopolitical balance. You‚Äôll be playing as various Soviet operatives in a selection of high-risk conflict zones, all of them linked by a common plot.REDSIDE will take you across half the world, from well-known conflict zones such as the Middle East to less-known heat spots like Zaire, other than also undercover operations in Europe. Each setting is well-diversified and there clearly was some degree of research to make places look believable. The situations you‚Äôll find yourself into are also plausible for the most part, even if there is some degree of infeasibility for the sake of the story.The story is not complex and rather straightforward: terrorist groups set up a potential supply line for weapons of mass destruction; find out who they are, dismantle the whole thing so that the Soviet Union is proven to be a first-rate world power in keeping order. Each character has some degree of personality and bits of backstory, although REDSIDE isn‚Äôt a story-focused game and most of the lore, dialogues will be related to the task at hand, operations and ROEs.  ExplorationLet‚Äôs start with the fact that each of REDSIDE‚Äôs levels is linear and follows a rigid structure: you‚Äôll be corralled through a determined path, with a more open world being only present in a specific mission. There won‚Äôt be a map to consult, however objective markers will guide you in most situations, and each zone isn‚Äôt complex enough to get lost in it anyway. As far as map design is concerned, REDSIDE does a good job. Despite the destructibility of many elements like crates, barrels, select buildings, vehicles and more, you won‚Äôt be able to plow your way through as you please ‚Äú√† la battlefield‚Äù - at most, you may tear down doors and windows. There isn‚Äôt really much to be found: no lore files, pickups or anything of value, apart from the occasional weapon crate or light switch to make some areas darker.Combat SystemThis is a title that emphasizes realism, careful pacing and positioning above all else in each and every fight. As well-trained your operative may be, you‚Äôre only human after all. This concept is conveyed well, with both you and enemies having a fast time-to-kill; headshots are a guaranteed death, as are random critical hits, most explosions - if you‚Äôre out of cover, at least. Cover is an important concept that allows your character to suddenly become the Man of Steel himself; stand near a large object such as a wall or a pile of sandbags to gain Full Cover, that will greatly reduce any damage sustained - smaller objects only provide Half Cover, while being in an open field will debuff you with the Exposed status, lowering your accuracy and making you take extra damage. On paper this concept is great, but it‚Äôs implemented horribly. The main issue is that cover is granted in all directions: have a house wall on your back, but they‚Äôre shooting you from the front where you have nothing? Doesn‚Äôt matter, full cover it is. I can‚Äôt understate how broken this becomes on more than a few occasions, makes no sense whatsoever. Enemies don‚Äôt seem to use cover or be influenced by this mechanic at all, same goes for your (immortal) teammates. The pathfinding of all NPCs is so bugged and horrendous anyway, that even if cover worked it wouldn‚Äôt do much good. In combat you‚Äôll be able to carry two weapons and six grenades: while the former have unlimited ammo, grenades are limited, and for good reason: they‚Äôre extremely powerful, able to be thrown above obstacles at ludicrous distances, with high AoE and enormous damage. Some weapons have special properties like being silenced or able to pierce walls: the former have heavily reduced damage and aren‚Äôt very useful, while the latter are overpowered, allowing you to stay inside buildings and shoot through walls as if you had wallhack (especially because you can still see outside while inside buildings).Stealth & VehiclesSome missions desperately try to promote and emphasize stealth, which works by putting yourself in either a dark area or in bushes that conceal your person. Enemies that see a body (you can‚Äôt move bodies, by the way), hear shots, see you or see a death will alert everyone else immediately, making them converge on your position. Generally enemies are placed close to each other or in a way that makes stealth unfeasible or impractical - just going guns blazing is faster, better and has no consequence whatsoever, apart from aggroing more enemies - you won‚Äôt lose because of it, maybe make your life harder (or easier, since more enemies are better than having to deal with this half-broken system).On rare occasions, vehicles such as armored cars, UAVs or mobile AA can be used to lay utter devastation upon enemy ranks. Heavily armored, with unlimited ammo and powerful weapons, these beasts will enable you to plow through anything with ease - although being reckless will get you killed all the same, eventually.

With lore that doesn‚Äôt go anywhere, broken balance and lackluster polishing, ER doesn‚Äôt shine in any way to make it worthwhile.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2848289804In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingAs in the best (worst?) horror b-movies, our unnamed protagonist survives a car accident in the middle of a forest, only to realize the nearby town is infested by all sorts of monsters, ranging from demons to bio-abominations. In a very plausible surge of courage, pistol in hand, he charges ahead slinging lead to whatever supernatural creature unfortunate enough to cross his path. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know where I am, I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs going on, I only know I must kill‚Äù, as a wise man once said.ER takes place in an unspecified rural town of an unclear, probably made-up country (like Narnia, Serbia or something along those lines) where everything has clearly gone to hell. Between the various, colorful contaminants littering most areas, and the plentiful ritualistic symbols drawn all over, it appears soon enough that this peaceful location has transformed into a nightmare. While the environment ‚Äòdoes the job‚Äô at conveying a dark atmosphere, the low-quality writing of most files and descriptions found around the world degrades both immersion and worldbuilding. Don‚Äôt expect an involving or deep experience at any point, as far as story and lore are concerned.Exploration & PuzzlesBe it forests, lagoons, factories or subterranean bunkers, the gig is the same: you‚Äôll be wandering about largely linear levels (with a few more ‚Äòopen‚Äô exceptions), that prove restrictive even for a Shooter, let alone a Survival Horror (which ER isn‚Äôt). While there are some secondary, minimally-diverging paths to find - that often hold a couple resources like ammo or medkits - most levels will still feel like one-way paths without enough expansion, verticality or diversity to result interesting. There are very few proper secrets overall, and they aren‚Äôt such a big deal either - some ammo or healing again, just like that crate you found in a corner five minutes ago.There are a few simplistic puzzles that involve finding a switch to open a gate, rotate props in the correct positions, or activate devices in a certain order to make a boss vulnerable. None of them is particularly obscure, and generally they‚Äôre all quick to solve or deal with. In case the levels weren‚Äôt linear enough, there will be guidance arrows shining on the ground on several occasions as well.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2848290103Combat System & BossesMost areas come packed with reasonably-varied monsters that either are already present or spawn when a certain point is passed, or a specific action (like flipping a switch) is executed. You‚Äôll have a roster of ten total weapons at your disposal, progressively found around the levels, each of them using different ammo types, which are however abundantly present. Special mention to your pistol, which has unlimited bullets that can also travel beyond the screen and hit far-away enemies; this, alongside the generally low enemy speed and their lackluster intelligence, leads to a major issue. Most encounters can actually be cleared by simply backpedaling in a circle while spamming pistol rounds until everything is dead, while stationary enemies can be hit beyond their view range with ease. It feels like all foes are weak, fragile and don't pose much of a threat unless you manage to get cornered, which rarely happens due to their slowness - I never died to normal ones.The other weapons aside from the handgun often deal tremendous damage / DPS, and are best saved for bosses or the rarely-seen bigger hordes of normal mobs - you won‚Äôt even need them most of the time, despite there being enough ammo around to use them to your heart‚Äôs content if you want to. There‚Äôs a grand total of three bosses: one is a bigger copy-paste of a normal ranged enemy, the other is just a melee foe (slowly) chasing you, and the final boss is a stationary, glorified turret with extra steps to make it vulnerable. None of these fights feels epic, and while bosses do hurt a lot for a change, they can easily be kited around or baited into shooting into cover. They have low health compared to the damage most weapons do: a couple shots of powerful weapons like the grenade launcher will be all it takes to dispatch them.Equipment & ProgressionIn this ‚Äúsurvival horror‚Äù, you won‚Äôt even have an inventory to manage; all of your findings like ammo or medkits will automatically be added to your total, uncapped for first aid and capped for ammo. There‚Äôs nothing else to find besides these things and the new weapons themselves, which don‚Äôt require puzzles or special actions to be gained: you‚Äôll find more guns around this little town than in a military base. The other part of the progression is represented by a basic stat system that can be upgraded once your character levels up (you can‚Äôt even see the XP left to do so). You may invest points in Speed (as in movement), Healing (medkit usage speed, which always restores 100% of HP anyway, and can be used instantly while on the move already, making this attribute useless) and Accuracy, which greatly improves the Pistol and possibly other bullet-based firearms‚Äô damage: straight up the best investment. Another underwhelming aspect that doesn‚Äôt feel like a real improvement of your abilities or equipment most of the time.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2848290023 ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1478590,13 August,1.9,1.9

The content is entirely linear, there‚Äôs no reason whatsoever to replay.Is it worth buying?No. Even if the budget price of 13,29‚Ç¨ is more than fair for the amount of content delivered, its tedious evolution combined with the other issues makes this a title to avoid even for fans of the genre.Verdict: MediocreRating Chart HereFoN 2 somewhat improves upon its predecessor, but fundamental issues remain and drag it down once more, just not as badly as the first entry.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2844463304In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingAn average guy (or girl), as in -you-, gets transported to a far-away island after touching a mysterious altar that appears in the middle of a workshop (because who wouldn‚Äôt do that?). Soon enough, a ghost says that you happen to be in a world once governed by the ‚ÄòAncients‚Äô, that used the power of the Force of Nature to accomplish great things. Alas the magical stone has been split into various shards in a (yet) unclear way, and your only way to get back to your world is finding them all.Lore and story aren‚Äôt at all FoN‚Äôs focus. As you proceed, there will be other ghosts to talk with, that will tell you their (brief) stories, some info about the world, and how they came to be in their current situation. Other than that, there‚Äôs mention of Tablets to find in order to know more, but I was unable to find any, as there‚Äôs no clear explanation on how to do so or even where to look for them.Exploration & Resource GatheringThe world is divided in various biomes, each featuring its own roster of enemies, resources and unique conditions. For instance, you better invest in some poison resistance gear to better handle the Swamp, and it will be mandatory to have heat-resistant clothes to explore volcanic zones. Each area is fairly large and while resources do not respawn, there‚Äôs such a quantity of them that running out is unlikely - enemies can be respawned using a bed, but only if you want to. In terms of exploration, the main thing to do will be finding all the new resources upon entering a new area, and gathering them for processing at your base. There don‚Äôt seem to be tool requirements for doing so, but of course better tools will do the job much faster. There are no random events, special places to find, unique enemies or anything like that: every zone is ‚Äúplain‚Äù and same-y: no reason to explore the whole thing, just go straight to your objective instead.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2845267391Base Building & Crafting SystemThe base is where you‚Äôll spend most of your time. While buildable anywhere, the fast travel system and least danger make the initial island the best place for doing so. A grid-like system allows precise placement of buildings, facilities and so on, which can also be moved at will with minimal time waste. Gotta say, the organizational features are spot on. Unlocking new buildings, weapons and other recipes involves research, which itself needs processing numerous materials into byproducts (for example, ink requires eggs, ash and other stuff, each itself processed by other raw materials). If this system is fair enough at first, the permutations of processing steps eventually become overwhelming. Later-game structures, consumables and gear require literal hours spent running about the couple dozen different crafting stations you‚Äôll have by that point, each for specific things. While the initial Ghost, ‚ÄòWanderer‚Äô will keep crafting queues going while you‚Äôre away he‚Äôll do so slowly, plus the queues are at best three steps long, without the possibility of pre-planning longer ones. I can‚Äôt emphasize enough how tedious this becomes: imagine playing Factorio but having to do everything by hand in late-game, that‚Äôs how it feels.Combat System & BossesBiomes are chock-full of enemies, and exploring inevitably will lead to conflict. Foes award not only materials, but also XP that will eventually level your character up, enabling you to spend three SPs per level in passive and active abilities, most of which level-gated at first. Apart from a select few, most of such skills and later on spells prove underwhelming or downright useless. The fighting itself consists in auto-attacking enemies until each is dead, while triggering consumables such as food (and later on potions) to stay alive. Imagine playing an ARPG like Diablo, right, but without having all those fantastic skills to use, and having to auto-attack enemies for dozens of hours on end. Enemies are monotonous, changing in shape or size but rarely feeling unique: there‚Äôs always the melee one and the ranged one, without more specialized behaviors or patterns to distinguish them most of the time.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2845440571Side Mechanics & Hidden QuestsEach biome containing a boss inevitably will spawn a Ghost once the big bad guy is dealt with. It‚Äôs possible to ‚Äútame‚Äù these creatures. No matter the place, the required task always involves exploring every inch of the biome at hand, which means kicking an enormous amount of shovelware enemies,translating in tremendous amounts of food to stay alive. Is this worth it for some more crafting speed in the base? No, it‚Äôs not, and adds even more tedium to an already heart-stoppingly boring formula. Good thing I had Sons of Anarchy on my second display while playing this slog.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1316230,13 August,56.0,56.0

The regular tag of 25‚Ç¨ is definitely too steep for this amount of content, despite the overall good quality. I recommend waiting for a sale even to fans of narrative-driven titles.Verdict: GoodRating Chart HereA competent adventure that however doesn‚Äôt use its lore and setting to the full potential, and feels rushed in later parts. It‚Äôs good, but could‚Äôve been much better.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2842347012In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingYoung aspirant-engineer Shane lives in a time full of technological marvels, but also unforgiving beliefs. Dropped on a deserted island by his own father, he needs to overcome a decades-old process known as ‚ÄúThe Trial‚Äù in order to return to Gideon, a steampunk flying city, and be acclaimed as a true Engineer ready to give their all for the pursuit of the common good. There‚Äôs no middle ground: success or death.Most of HSK will take place on a couple of islands with minimal infrastructure, on which Shane and the other aspirants before him have attempted building improvised machines to return to the golden city. It‚Äôs common to find mementos of those who came before - alongside more than a few corpses. There‚Äôs a stark contrast in seeing these pristine islands scarred by Gideon‚Äôs trial infrastructure, now mostly left to decay. Each location is rich in detail, and the attentive observer will find many ‚Äòself-contained‚Äô tales related to each.The lore files, ranging from radio transmissions about the current turmoil brewing in Gideon, to ancient texts about folklore and art - things mostly forgotten in the current era - are all written consistently well. More than a few will pique the reader‚Äôs interest, making them think there‚Äôs more than meets the eye on these islands, and that occult forces may be at work. Unfortunately, on many of such topics HSK stops elaborating soon enough, or doesn‚Äôt at all, in what seems like cutting corners as the campaign goes on.Exploration & PlatformingYour primary activity will be running around the current island in the search of anything useful to proceed towards Gideon. For this purpose, blueprints will often be placed in major locations, easy to find, and they‚Äôll tell you exactly what you need to do in order to restore the current unfinished machine, in the hopes it will be enough to complete the mission. Usually, this is a multi-step process that involves finding components all over a larger area that you can explore in an open.world fashion, thus leaving space to optional findings and collectibles, should you care about those.There are several platforming sections of jumping, sliding and climbing, rather simple overall, that act as a nice break in the ‚Äòwalking simulator‚Äô pacing and give some more action to the gameplay. Should you splat from a high place or get impaled, don‚Äôt worry, you‚Äôll restart from one of the plentiful auto-checkpoints placed around, without much progress loss.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2842346789PuzzlesAs a soon-to-be engineer, problem-solving should be a primary skill, that‚Äôs why the trial islands have been purposefully designed in a way that encourages such a process. In your journey, you‚Äôll come across half-finished pieces of machinery, sealed gates, generators in need of new batteries and more. Each of these situations will require you to figure out the correct order of doing things, like operating a crane to move parts in the correct places, or diving underwater to activate switches, other than figuring out codes to open many locks barring your path. None of these puzzles will be overly-difficult, but some are designed in a rather counter-intuitive way.Assembling machinery is much simpler than you‚Äôd think, with Shane doing most of the work automatically, with simple button prompts as commands. It would‚Äôve been more exciting to try and fail a few times just like a real engineer would while assembling experimental creations, alas it wasn‚Äôt so.Optional AreasThe islands house many a secret for those willing to look. Those who came before didn‚Äôt always ruish like mad to return to Gideon, in fact some developed other interests that will be clear enough when visiting what remains of their avenues. Books, messages, transmissions and even scrawling on the walls will each reveal a bit more about the various aspirants that came before, their choices, and eventually what led to their demise. Here HSK delves into topics like the occult, the paranormal and also freedom of choice about one‚Äôs pursuits. While the idea behind this premise is good, the narrative never pushes it enough to make it relevant compared to the main goal. These optional areas also may house collectibles and Keys, useful to open chests or locks that may be in wholly other parts, and often lead to significant lore revelations or hidden areas.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2841986474MinigamesA few minigames are available to further break the otherwise linear gameplay pacing. One of them consists in playing a guitar with a series of tunes that can be combined to play specific songs eventually found in the various notes and books you‚Äôll discover. One of them supposedly even leads to a secret ending, but I wasn‚Äôt able to figure it out. Another minigame is about assembling machines, with Shane welding, stapling and nailing bits and bobs in order to make whatever piece of junk work - somehow.

There isn‚Äôt enough replayability to warrant doing so at all.- Even if worthwhile, the optional content often proves dull and acts as filler to inflate the campaign's length in a cheap way.- Intergrade‚Äôs story goes on until the party leaves Midgar for good, which is about 35% of the total. This isn‚Äôt a complete remake, as the devs decided to split the whole thing in three instances, for whatever reason, instead of doing everything in the same game.üü® Bugs & Issuesüîß Specs- Occasional stuttering and frame-rate drops, even on a machine that exceeds recommended specs.- Hard difficulty is locked behind beating the game once.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:It took me 46 hours to complete the story on Normal, while also clearing all secondary content. After that, NG+ mode with some additional battles / bosses, and spin-off episode ‚ÄúIntermission‚Äù offer more content. Despite that, the game is largely linear and I don‚Äôt see a reason to replay it once cleared, as the NG+ content doesn‚Äôt warrant going through mostly the same stuff again.Is it worth buying?Yes, but not for the staggering base price of 80‚Ç¨. Even with the overall solid quality and content amounts, I suggest waiting for at least a 30% discount even to the most hardcore fans, to get value for your money.Verdict: Very GoodRating Chart HereAn overall impressive remake, but not without issues. Fans of the series will rejoice in experiencing its expanded lore and story, but also get bored by the excessive filler.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835932186In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingThe city of Midgar stands as a shining beacon of technology in an otherwise desolate wasteland, using the all-powerful Mako energy to maintain its modern standards of living. Shinra Corporation de-facto rules above all, being the ones that built and maintained the reactors. Turns out using the planet‚Äôs vital energy as fuel isn‚Äôt the best choice long-term, so a group of ‚Äòeco-terrorists‚Äô called Avalanche wants to put a stop to Shinra‚Äôs ambitions by destroying the whole shebang. Protagonist Cloud Strife, ex-Shinra elite now turned rogue, is hired by the insurgents to help them fight the power - that‚Äôs how your story begins.This remake not only expands upon the original characters, but introduces many all-new ones, each with their own backstory. Generally speaking, they‚Äôre interesting enough and add to the story in a good way, with personalities distinct and remarkable enough to not feel generic. Between item descriptions, enemy files and lore entries, there‚Äôs a good amount of optional info about the world for those interested, personally I found this aspect interesting, as much of it wasn‚Äôt elaborated upon in the original FFVII.Exploration & Level DesignUntil late-game the levels will be largely linear, with just a few side-areas to explore for loot and some ‚Äòopen‚Äô areas that act as containers for side-quest-giving NPCs. Later on, fast-travel between various sectors becomes available, allowing you to finish eventual leftover quests and explore each area accurately at will - not much to find, though, as far as secrets go. Vendors are available in some places in the form of machines or actual people, who will sell you new weapons, unique accessories, Materia, and sometimes give you quests and minigames  to earn trinkets or other stuff not obtainable in any other way.The ‚Äòrandom encounters‚Äô with enemies have been reworked into seamless transitions between battle and exploration, that you can also skip by simply running away in many cases - a welcome addition. It‚Äôs annoying that many sections have scripted sequences where characters move at a deliberately slower pace, in most cases adding tedium instead of scenic buildup.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2835932350Combat SystemInstead of the turn-based system of the original VII, this remake opts for real-time battles where you control one character at time, while the other two are left to the AI, though you can switch between them at any time. Hitting enemies with basic attacks will fill your ATB gauge, essential to use spells, abilities, items and pretty much do anything else - your companions will behave competently while in the hands of the computer, but won‚Äôt use higher skills unless you switch and order them directly - mostly, they‚Äôll just stand there and soak up damage, or attack enemies when appropriate.The combat mechanics have been expanded upon, now featuring ‚ÄòStagger‚Äô and ‚ÄòPressure‚Äô effects, both critical to winning battles; deal great damage in a short time, and enemies will progressively build up stagger, making them extremely vulnerable for a short time - a circumstance that can also be triggered by targeting weak points or other specific actions unique to each enemy. For the rest, expect abilities, spells and items as in any JRPG, with particular emphasis on elemental weaknesses and status effect dispelling as keys to winning the more demanding fights. Summons are also a thing, but only in specific battles, and work as temporary NPCs you can‚Äô√¨t control directly, but spend ATB to trigger their abilities instead.Special mention for bosses, which prove elaborate and unique at all times, not to mention challenging and full of interesting mechanics that break the canons of battle, forcing you to get creative. The only critique I would make to bosses is that they won‚Äôt allow you to fully go through a well-planned combo if their health goes low enough, thus triggering a cutscene and resetting their status immediately, even while staggered or otherwise incapacitated.Character Management & ProgressionCompleting quests and killing mobs will credit you EXP, AP and SP. Now, these ‚Äòcurrencies‚Äô of sorts can be used to respectively increase character levels, something that happens automatically, level-up equipped Materia (also automatic) and enhance weapons, since each of them has its own skill tree of passive abilities, and is generally better-suited for different roles. Not only that, but each new weapon comes with a unique signature ability you can ‚Äòmaster‚Äô and permanently learn as a skill. Think of Materia as swappable abilities you can slot in weapons and accessories, to build your characters for the roles you prefer - only equipped materia will level up, thus unlocking new proprieties or stronger spell versions, so make sure you focus on what you really need as it‚Äôs impossible to get everything maxed out in one playthrough, unless you do a hell of a lot of grinding. https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2838803345 ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1462040,26 July,46.0,46.0

Each room is interesting to unlock and explore‚Ä¶ the first time, at least.- Decent replay value thanks to multiple endings and different possible paths to take.- Logical environmental interaction that plays out in a plausible way using the items at hand.- Tremendously unfair death-related mechanics designed to kill in ways you can‚Äôt possibly anticipate the first time. This creates ‚Äòfiller content‚Äô via backtracking, since the world resets on each death.- Generic storyline, mediocre writing of lore documents.

Mouse usage is limited to aiming / looking around, all menus need to be navigated with Arrow Keys or WASD without key rebinding.

Move on to better survival horrors, there‚Äôs plenty around.Verdict: BadRating Chart HereA poorly-executed survival horror that relies on annoying mechanics to stretch content, alongside an obnoxious protagonist and a forgettable story.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832333700In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingNaked and terrified, you‚Äôll wake up in a bathtub full of bloodied water. You don‚Äôt have the slightest idea of what happened, and now you‚Äôre locked in a motel bathroom. After getting your bearings and finding a way out, you‚Äôll soon understand things aren‚Äôt alright at all in this decrepit, half-totaled motel, between unearthly screams and horrendous abominations that roam the locales.Most of Oxide is set in a three-story motel under renovation. The horror feeling is kinda there, with most premises being dark, damp, foggy and eerie, as well compounded by an audio compartment that does the job well enough. Too bad this is all ruined by Matt (as in, you) constantly stating ‚Äúhe needs to get out‚Äù, or describing events / items with a tone as robotic as a train station‚Äôs automated announcer. Some classic ‚Äòcheap jumpscares‚Äô are added to the mix at times, and they fail to impress.Numerous lore documents pertaining to yourself, or other relevant characters, can be found in the furniture, on the ground and generally all over the place. Each of the writers is distinct enough in their tone, however the content itself feels quite clich√®d and just doesn‚Äôt hook you the right way at any point. ‚ÄúMad scientist doing crazy experiments‚Äù trope? Check! ‚ÄúGuy who lost humanity and now is on a vengeance‚Äù? Sure! ‚ÄúToken female character that doesn‚Äôt know what the hell to do‚Äù? Yep! Horror tropes 101, everyone.Exploration & PuzzlesYour primary goal will be opening as many rooms as you can, in the hopes of finding a way to the third floor‚Äôs common areas, the only exit still available. Think of each room as a self-contained mini-puzzle, as most of them will have one or more items to interact with, that often require you figuring out a specific item order, a code, or the right item to use between several. There is always a right way and several wrong ways to get something done, the latter ones often inflicting you a detrimental status effect, or killing you instantly in a few cases.The main issue is that in many instances, not only is there no clear way to figure out what‚Äôs right or wrong, but you‚Äôll also be actively deceived by Oxide itself. For example, I found the number ‚Äú15‚Äù behind a closet, and said to myself ‚Äúthat must be the correct vial, among five, i have to pick for this puzzle!‚Äù - nope, I got poisoned and died instead. Expect this to happen numerous times, and if you ran out of supplies, well‚Ä¶ goodbye!Exploring the premises will indeed net you a modest number of consumables, like bandages or antidotes, vital to clear the effects that otherwise become lethal in around 30-40 seconds or so. Even by collecting all of them, there‚Äôll be no way in Hell you‚Äôll be able to get out alive on your first run: too many shenanigans you can‚Äôt predict.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832658783Combat & Inventory ManagementYour trusty revolver will be the only means of defense against the horrors. Bullets are a fairly common finding, and most enemies take five to vanquish. It's a simple point-and-shoot affair, with a small quick time event to free yourself from an enemy‚Äôs grab, and no other particular mechanic, since all except one enemy are static threats. It has to be noted enemies have a detection system, some of them can be ‚Äòstealthed‚Äô but this is inconsistent - most will just spawn and target you immediately after certain interactions, though.Up to nine inventory slots can be gained, via some items found in the various rooms. This is very limited compared to the amount of  unique stuff you‚Äôll find (like keys), but the shared stashes alleviate part of the issue by letting you deposit items for later use, and retrieve them at any time. And yet, expect to backtrack back and forth numerous times for this.Death-related MechanicsSo, what happens exactly when you die? Don‚Äôt worry, I'll now explain to you the peak of game design we have to deal with here. Upon your demise, a story-related cutscene will play, different each time, and you‚Äôll be back to square one at the bathtub. Everything has been reset: stash, inventory, upgrades, doors are locked again. Some things changed, though: certain enemy spawn have been altered, and on later deaths more foes will spawn, like poison plants. Most item spawns remain the same, except for a very few that change slightly. This would be fine and interesting if implemented properly - not the case here.The thing is, nothing major changes with death, apart from more enemies to deal with and the ending you‚Äôll get. You‚Äôll have to do the exact same things again twice, thrice, etc. - each time with added annoyances. This becomes tedious, boring very soon, and given the game kills you in unpredictable ways as explained before, this creates a perfect storm of frustration. Don‚Äôt think of this as ‚Äòold school‚Äô because it isn‚Äôt, it‚Äôs simply badly designed.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2832658863 ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1819180,9 July,3.7,3.7

Some moderate issues prevent it from realizing its full potential.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830781616In-DepthPremise, Setting & Writing1944. Italy is ravaged by the misery of war, with Allied forces moving up towards the Tuscany region while Axis troops mount a desperate defense. Protagonist Giulia K. is the daughter of a high-profile Nazi officer, but even this privileged position doesn‚Äôt save her from tragedy. One day, her twin sister Martha is found dead in a lake - an overwhelming loss. She always was her parents‚Äô favorite, unlike Giulia, so the latter decides to take her identity, pretending to be her from that moment forward, to gain the love so far denied to her.MiD mostly takes place in and around a countryside villa outside the village of San Casciano, Tuscany. There‚Äôs a remarkable attention to detail in the realization of each location, from the interiors of a typical upper-class 1940 Italian household, with luxuries such as electric power and a phone line, to the verdant woods and sun-beaten dirt paths commonly seen in the rural areas of the region even today. The marked contrast between these idyllic landscapes and the brutality of war, or the horrifying visions in Giulia‚Äôs mind, creates a rollercoaster of varied atmospheres that works out very well.Apart from the protagonist, there‚Äôs a small roster of relevant characters that, however, never happen to dialogue directly with you at any point: a consequence of the recent events, and of the pretense Giulia decided to put up. You‚Äôll hear conversations, read missives, listen to telephone calls, but never engage in active dialogues save for some phone calls at specific points. The writing feels plausible, with an Italian voiceover that accounts for the different mannerisms and speech patterns of the time. Most situations feel plausible and realistic, even if (probably by design) you‚Äôll end up questioning the veracity of some of them as the game progresses. Exploration & InvestigationThe story plays out through a number of days, each having a primary objective related to the events at hand, and a series of optional activities as well. Generally, you‚Äôll be able to explore the world freely at any time, with the primary areas being the villa and its courtyard, the nearby forest and the lake. Some places will be locked until specific events happen, or certain quests are triggered by your findings. Your trusty camera will be of paramount importance, as it will not only allow you to collect evidence in order to shed light on your sister‚Äôs death, but also to use filters (such as infrared) to reveal the unseen. There are a vast number of interactable objects that reveal more about the family‚Äôs past, the general lore or the people related to you in some way, each of them is voice-narrated by Giulia. Those looking to do everything will find much information in these optional interactions, they‚Äôre definitely worth the extra time spent.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2831372692Secondary QuestsWhile your focus remains finding the truth about Martha‚Äôs death, there will be other things to do as well. For instance, hidden riddles can be found by photographing specific objects in the world, optional points of interest that reveal dark stories, or trigger quests altogether. These missions may be optional, but contain a good chunk of unique content, such as puzzles, minigames and sub-storylines regarding parallel ongoing events. Some of these elements also can be missed, since the game progresses in a series of days alongside the main quest‚Äôs evolution: after certain events unfold, some areas may not be accessible anymore, thus locking the quests out forever (unless you reload an earlier save). Going just for the main story is something I wouldn‚Äôt recommend, as these secondary missions, even if a tad annoying in pacing at times, prove overall interesting and expand on the narrative considerablyPuzzles & MinigamesThe most frequent type of puzzle will be associated with photography: relevant items to frame, both primary and secondary, will be highlighted on your HUD, and it will be up to you to use the right camera accessories, such as filters, and set the right zoom level, exposure and focus to get the perfect shot. Not only that, but photos also need to be developed in a dark room, which involves a simple button-pressing prompt as QTE. Other than that, you‚Äôll eventually be decoding telegraph ciphers, finding items such as keys to unlock doors, boxes and passages containing critical items, or figure out the right things to say in a phone call to extract information. There are also a few quick-time events here and there, but they‚Äôre fairly simple and not demanding in skill or reflexes at all, in line with the genre‚Äôs expectations.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830781865 ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/515960,7 July,9.6,9.6

Ranged is OP, 2H is just a DPS downgrade compared to anything else, Dual has a horrendous moveset, 1H / Shield is just plain.- Mechanically shallow. Many features customary to the Souls genre are emaciated or downright absent; this makes progression, combat and build-crafting too simplistic.- Story, lore and characters feel insipid and cliched. It never hooks you at any point, leaves a sour aftertaste once the credits roll.- Boring level design, that results way too linear for the genre, with only two ‚Äúhidden‚Äù optional areas in total, and nothing else of interest to find or get excited for at any point.- Disappointing co-op system design: not only does it require random consumable drops to function, but is also restricted to bosses only.üü® Bugs & Issuesüîß Specs- Unreliable hit detection with certain enemies or weapon move sets.- RTX makes little visual difference in general, and isn‚Äôt worth using.- 3900X- 2080Ti- 32GB RAM- SSD- 1440pContent & Replay Value:Took me around 12 hours to clear a run (logged 15h ‚Äòcause I restarted once early on), while taking time to explore all locations accurately. There is some replay value in experimenting with a different build (which isn‚Äôt gonna be a totally different experience, unlike in some other Souls), everything else stays the same.Is it worth buying?No. The price of 40‚Ç¨ is way too steep for this amount of content, features and quality -  even discounted, this will always be a mediocre title. There are other sci-fi souls (Surge 1-2, Shattered to name some) much better than this for the same or lower cost.Verdict: MediocreRating Chart HereA subpar attempt at Indie Souls-like. Ultimately DOLMEN feels generic, uninspired, simplistic and devoid of any polishing despite some genuinely interesting ideas. Genre veterans may have some fun with it, but it‚Äôs objectively not a good title.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2828724614In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingRevion Prime was just another anonymous planet under Zoan control (your faction, by the way), until the powerful DOLMEN Crystals were discovered on it. Some scientists got their hands full, started experimenting with trans-dimensional technology, and made a real mess of things - on top of other factions wanting a slice of the cake. Guess who has to clean up the mess?If the classic trope of ‚Äúsomeone fiddled with stuff they couldn‚Äôt comprehend and screwed up reality‚Äù sounds clich√®, that‚Äôs because it is. Despite locales actually feeling diverse and reasonably well-designed, at no point the narrative premise evolves past ‚Äúbash everyone in your way to get the damn crystals‚Äù or has any memorable character. We have the power-tripped supervillain, the zero-charm protagonist that says probably five lines in the entire game, the generic utilitarian radio operator, and a slew of NPCs with the personality of a rusted wheelbarrow, that have no quests or backstories whatsoever. Not even the optional lore files salvage it, as they never really prove interesting.ExplorationDOLMEN plays out as a classic souls-like in this part, meaning you‚Äôll be roaming various locales crawling with enemies, look out for the occasional item to collect, and most importantly activate Beacons (bonfires), which allow you to restore HP and Batteries (Estus), but also respawn enemies. Beacons also allow you to fast-travel between each, and teleport to your ship which contains crafting, cosmetic and leveling-up facilities, plus a totally useless NPC that just stands there staring at you menacingly.Don‚Äôt expect a complex level layout with exciting secrets and mind-bending verticality or hidden shortcuts: most levels are linear, with just a couple exceptions - most don‚Äôt even have any real shortcut or looping design at all. The only reasons to explore are crates with crafting materials, hidden NPCs that grant unique parts and lore files, but that‚Äôs all rather easy to find.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2828761665Combat System & BossesBread and butter of the experience, the combat here has some good ideas, admittedly. First of all, healing doesn‚Äôt work as you may be accustomed to for this genre. Energy (as in, Mana) acts as your healing medium, and can only be recharged with Batteries, coming in limited amounts and restored at Beacons - Estus Flask with extra steps. Mana also is used for Energy Mode, which is an amped-up status you can trigger at any time, that gives elemental powers to your attacks, other than also for ranged weapons and eventual weapon-specific abilities.The way elemental effects are handled is pretty good, as when enemies with one of the three status effects (Frozen, Burning, Poisoned) are hit with a weapon of that same element, this triggers powerful passive effects that deal significant amounts of damage - debuff first, hit second, that‚Äôs the way to go. This is a smart system that could have been built upon, but sadly it wasn‚Äôt so.Now onto the issues. The main issue with combat is the jank, with fiddly animations and mechanics that are about as reliable as that used car you bought last month from that shady salesman. What is customary in the genre just isn‚Äôt there: backstabs, ripostes, spells, stat-boosting consumables - all of this simply isn‚Äôt accounted for, making combat feel shallow not after long. The balance is all over the place really, with ranged easily overpowering everything else, alongside a fast melee as side to exploit elemental effects while energy recharges. Boss design feels average at best, with none of the fights really feeling epic despite their evolving movesets and sometimes considerable difficulty.Progression & CraftingEnemies and breakable elements drop crafting materials that can be used at the ship‚Äôs printer to craft progressively better weapons and armors, each with stat requirements to be used, of course. Each armor and weapon will contribute towards a certain Technology (Zoan, Driller, Revian) with passive abilities to match, think of it as a ‚Äòset bonus‚Äô of sorts. Crafted items can be further enhanced with Epic and Rare materials which give them better stats compared to the ‚Äúregular‚Äù versions. Unless you want to craft boss weapons, which require you to kill each boss three times (respawning them costs crystals with low drop rate), the rest of the materials will come along without particular grinding in general. You can use Nanites (souls) to improve your character stats permanently in the ship pod, and this works like in any other Souls game.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2828036749Multiplayer SystemYou can attempt bosses in jolly cooperation with your fellow DOLMEN players, using a beacon near each arena. The design of this is dement however, as it requires consumable, low-drop resources you can lose on death to be activated, no refunds in case you lose. Whoever thought gating multiplayer behind resource grinding was a good idea, didn‚Äôt think straight at all.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/831050,2 July,15.4,15.4

There is no reason to replay, either.Is it worth buying?The 35‚Ç¨ tag is fair for this amount of content and especially quality. I can definitely recommend a full-price purchase.Verdict: Very GoodRating Chart HereA brilliant sci-fi sandbox puzzle that manages to create a fresh gameplay formula. It‚Äôs a pity the story can‚Äôt be up to par with the other excellent elements.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2826400797In-DepthPremise, Setting & WritingStory-wise, HSB starts off with a not-so-novel premise: humanity became a space-faring civilization de-facto controlled by megacorporations, with alliances and governments losing more control as time passes. LYNX is the biggest fish of them all, having pioneered modern space travel, thus amassing ludicrous amounts of power and resources. That‚Äôs who you‚Äôll be working for as a shipbreaker, tasked with dismantling decommissioned vessels for the recycling market. The game pushes heavily on the themes of ethical treatment of workers and sustainability of employment. Your shipbreaking career will be contourned not only by the stories of your colleagues, each shedding more light on the grim state of humanity and on LYNX‚Äôs dehumanizing practices, but also reinforced by dozens of data recordings found in derelict ships. From your cramped living quarters to the overly-lawyered contracts and documents piling up in your inbox, the corporate dystopia seems all too real.Shipbreaking OperationsMost of your time will be spent in the shipyard, pulling apart vessels large and small to net LYNX a big stack of cash, in shifts lasting 15 minutes each (you can dedicate multiple shifts to the same ship, don‚Äôt worry). Each ship is made of the most diverse materials and appliances depending on its role (cargo, scientific, military‚Ä¶) but it all boils down to one thing: sorting the right stuff into the right ‚Äòbin‚Äô (either furnace, processor or barge) with most things being color-coded on your scanner for this purpose.You‚Äôll have three tools for this job: the cutter, able to slice through low-density materials, vaporize walls, provide access to sealed compartments: your number one ally in dismantling things correctly. Then you have the ‚Äògravity gun‚Äô, able to move heavy objects for you to push into the right bin, and later on create Tethers, that essentially act as self-pulling ropes to haul ship parts too big for you to handle. The last tool are demo charges, able to cut entire ships in half in a matter of seconds, but at the cost of risking damage to sensitive equipment, explosions, fire hazards - use their power wisely, and only as last resort. The passive scanner highlights objects and sorts them by purpose and color, so that you know what‚Äôs what without too much hassle.The amount of perfection in how destruction, physics, explosive decompressions, fires are all recreated is great, even in failure there is some kind of strange pleasure, in seeing a ship blown in literally hundreds of smithereens flying everywhere, or the mess left inside after a decompression gone wrong.If this sounds simple enough, you‚Äôll quickly realize it isn‚Äôt. Accidents happen - often: from a small fire burning a couple of cargo crates to a critical reactor meltdown blowing away half a ship, everything demolished or processed incorrectly will be deducted from your already miserable pay, and also make you fail company Salvage Goals (more on them later). You‚Äôll have to learn how to properly disassemble many kinds of engines, machinery, reactors, and deal with mishaps on the fly before they become critical. There are even ships with rogue AIs on them, scrambling the internal systems randomly and making your life hell. Should you die, a heavy fine will be applied, but you‚Äôll respawn without penalties.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2826879455Progression SystemDepending on your performance in salvaging, you‚Äôll be credited Rank Points and Lynx Point Upon fulfilling salvage goals, which are milestones in correctly dismantling each ship - of course, more complex or hazardous ships will reward more of them. You may spend LPs to upgrade your initially pretty bad tools, making them more resilient, efficient, or even add new functions to them. Your passive gear can be enhanced as well, for instance sensors can be improved to detect more item types, while your suit can be reinforced to make you withstand even harsher conditions. Once in a while the story itself will go on, unlocking tutorial ships that will illustrate critical game mechanics or teach you how to use a new upgrade - but that‚Äôs not always the case: sometimes, especially later on, you‚Äôll have to figure things out on your own. Side Activities & CollectiblesThere are few things to do aside from shipbreaking, and they mostly relate to collecting. Posters found in wrecks can be taken, and used to customize your habitation pod. Stickers, awarded for progression milestones or particularly good performances, can be put onto tools as a cosmetic enhancement, but serve no other purpose. At some point a ‚Äòship repair‚Äô minigame will come up, allowing you to illegally salvage components that should go to LYNX for your own purposes. Decrypting and listening (or reading) lost data recording can be interesting, as it sheds light on the state of the galaxy, but it will take a huge amount of time to find them all.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2826400964Additional Game ModesFree Play allows you to pick from any ship models, everything unlocked, to just have some fun either scrapping it correctly or blowing it to bits - sandbox no-consequence mode. Cutter‚Äôs RACE is sort of a time trial where you can compete against the clock to salvage a ship as fast - and as well - as humanly possible.

Reinterpretation of the PS1 classic that only shows the first 8-hours of Final Fantasy VII and stretch into a 33-hours game. The real problem is that they made structure and story changes that destroyed the magic of the original. If you haven't played FFVII before, I recommend the 1997 version first. Note: The review is based on my Final Fantasy VII Remake playthrough on PS4 and a replay the the original FFVII (PS4 port - Midgar Part) in 2020. ‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†ÄMy curator page‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä‚†Ä ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1462040,17 June,104.2,0.3

250,76561197991534991,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991534991/recommended/,Other,5,Recommended,10,1,"First released in 1995 for the SNES and designed by the ""Dream Team"" Hironobu Sakaguchi (creator of Square's Final Fantasy series), Yuji  Horii (creator of Enix's Dragon Quest series) and Akira  Toriyama (creator of the Dragonball mangas). The Steam version is based on the mobile port. I played it for the first time in 2018 and it's amazing how well this game has aged. For me its: Still one of the best JRPG ever made.Positive Straight forward time travel story with great pacing and no filler Replayability because of different endings Active Time Battle (ATM) System with NO separate fighting screen and random encounters Superb soundtrack (composed by Yasunori Mitsuda and Nobuo Uematsu) Original graphic mode: ""Similar to the original pixel art""  Fixed difficulty setting Native 16:9 support 4:3 support, to play it in fullscreen you have to change the system resolution to 4:3 Native Xbox One Controller support. DUALSHOCK 4 also supported Negative Modified mobile User Interface. No original SNES UI Partly custom controller binding. You could only change X, Y, B and A buttons The onscreen conroller buttons only shows the Xbox layout MY REVIEW SETUP: i7-6700K | 32 GB DDR4 | GTX 1080 FE | HDD install | Win 10 Pro |

Good storyline, as well as live pvp. Raids, dungeons, lost sectors for every taste and color. Donat does not affect the gameplay, only cosmetics Friendly community and also good developers (Besides that they added stasis,although, thank God they fix it)In other words, for those who like to take farm one weapon or another thing for about 1-3 months due to your worthless luck, welcome :DP.S.

That's my way of seeing it ignoring the road getting to your purpose.The challenge of the game for me is in two things:1. Earning coins: It's not simple to establish a good source of coins, as you get attacked and caught off guard at times which destroys all your work, and rebuilding deep into the game is suicide as you will encounter more enemies as the days go by.2. NPC speed: The builders you hire and command, the beggers you give coin and reason to walk to your town, all WALK so SLOWLY!!! I can't count the amount of times I saw a begger I payed die because he walked so slowly towards the town.DAYS will pass by the time far away builders will finally come to your position and get what you need done. Of course they can die easily if you didn't plan ahead their position when the enemy's horde pummels through your walls.These 2 incredible challenges made me too frustrated to continue playing normally, so I get a Cheat Engie table for some ""boosters"" as god mode, infinitie coins, archers that shoot more arrows a second than there are trees in the entire game, and so on.To summerize:The game is made beautifully made and is challenging!So prepare yourself for some tough times, but maybe you'll like the struggle. The beautiful sountrack and design will help you through it all, so have at it at your own risk.The price is fair, so don't wait for a sale and support these great developers!

But I like RPG games and don't really like visual novel genre so should i recommend it? I will, yes, because the writing is really good, stories, music and climat are good and enjoyable but gameplay which is usually the most important thing for me isn't really convincing, it is too basic, there are no real rpg elements, adventure yes, you will immerse some good written stories and you have some decision which will change what outcome, mostly cards you get but thats it. Also minus from technical side, videos are not working for me, I must skip them (my graphic card rtx 2060). Overall game is not terrible, it is good in its department and unique, can be fun, you can enjoy it, so I recommend.

You need to plan your strategy, in main game mode diplomacy is a key as you must help all (independent) space races to unite in alliance, all races are really much different so it is interesting goal, you are like a third side here and this is also unique. Events are there both random and planned by other races and you, everything is designed with some deep. Game looks very good, it has definitely very good music (really not expected this), everything is running very smooth. Often you need to take part in many quite similiar fight (like when fighting insurgents) which could be a ""con"" but they are very quick, enough so it is not bad.

Apr√®s tout il √©tait annonc√© comme voulant r√©volutionner le genre. N√©cessitant un vrai travail d'√©quipe pour une belle √©vasion de prison !Alors oui la coop√©ration est omnipr√©sente, vous n'avancerez pas sans votre pote et inversement. Mais non il ne r√©volutionne pas le genre, les m√©caniques de jeu sont tr√®s simples et r√©p√©titives tout en √©tant accompagn√©es de nombreux QTE. Soulevez-une poutre √† deux, enfoncez une porte √† deux, tendez votre main √† votre voisin, offrez-lui un passage afin qu'il vous r√©cup√®re de l'autre c√¥t√©... Voyez, rien de neuf dans tout √ßa.Et concernant la prison on s'en √©chappe tr√®s rapidement, elle n'a au final qu'une petite part dans ce jeu d√©j√† pas si long que √ßa (sa dur√©e de vie est de cinq √† six heures) et tr√®s lin√©aire. Et ce malgr√© le fait que c'√©tait un peu la force de vente du jeu.√Ä lire tout √ßa vous devez croire qu'il ne vaut pas le coup. Je vous rassure, si, il vaut le coup. Bon pas √† trente euros certes. Quinze est un prix plus juste.Il poss√®de une histoire bien √©crite, avec de bons rebondissements et au d√©roulement tr√®s int√©ressant bien qu'un brin rapide. Les liens qui vont se cr√©er entre L√©o et Vincent, les deux personnages principaux, sont sinc√®res et authentiques. On se prend vite au jeu ! Dommage que ce dernier soit d√©nu√© de difficult√©.Notez que certaines s√©quences offrent des sensations bizarres... Je parle ici de la conduite ou du tir. Peu nombreux sont ces moments et comme on n'est pas dans un FPS ou un jeu de voiture, √ßa se ressent. Les poursuites sont pas mal, la conduite est naze et les quelques phases de tir sont plut√¥t molles et peu immersives.Mais la qualit√© principale du titre r√©side dans sa gestion de la cam√©ra ! Que ce soit en local ou en ligne, votre √©cran sera obligatoirement partag√© avec celui de votre ami (que les personnages soient c√¥te √† c√¥te ou non ou que l'un des deux joueurs ait une cutscene) permettant ainsi de voir le d√©roulement des choses du point de vue de l'autre pour une meilleure coordination.Comme le jeu est en plus loin d'√™tre moche √ßa offre quelques belles prises de vue et des moments intenses de deux points de vue diff√©rents pour un rendu encore plus fort !Retrouvez mes critiques sur ma page SensCritique ![www.senscritique.com] ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1222700,30 June,6.2,6.2

Si, personnellement, je n'ai rencontr√© aucun probl√®me lors de ma centaine d'heures de jeu sur Gears 5, ce DLC lui m'a rendu fou.Entre l'acte 3 injouable en solo car le jeu ne charge pas la suite, emp√™chant toute avanc√©e car mon personnage se retrouve bloqu√© sur une plateforme, interdit de toute action et les objectifs qui ne se mettent pas √† jour, bloquant al√©atoirement l'histoire, c'est un enfer. Heureusement qu'il est jouable en coop√©ration, j'ai profit√© d'une partie en ligne pour pouvoir d√©couvrir la campagne, l'h√¥te n'avait visiblement pas les bugs que j'ai rencontr√©.J'ai pourtant fait une v√©rification des fichiers, et un fichier √©tait manquant. Mais apr√®s t√©l√©chargement de ce dernier, les probl√®mes √©taient toujours l√†.Si le sc√©nario en lui-m√™me est int√©ressant, restant au m√™me niveau d'√©criture que les autres campagnes des diff√©rents Gears of War, force est d'admettre que les personnages sont bien moins attachants. On y incarne Keegan, Mac ou Lahni de l'escouade Scorpio, introduite aux joueurs via le mode fuite du jeu initial. Explorant des endroits jusque-l√† non abord√©s dans la saga Gears of War, nous allons d√©couvrir le pourquoi du comment ces personnages se retrouvent √† d√©truire les ruches des vermines de l'int√©rieur.Si Keegan est charismatique, Mac est inint√©ressant et Lahni est oubliable. De plus, l'histoire est trop courte pour que les liens qui se d√©veloppent entre eux soient approfondis, on a du coup l'impression que leur relation √©volue trop vite par rapport √† la situation, le tout saupoudr√© de dialogues d'une banalit√© compl√®te.Si Gears 5 s'essayait √† l'ouverture du jeu fa√ßon open-world, Hivebusters tente l'ajout des capacit√©s ultimes √† une campagne solo. Les joueurs ayant l'habitude du multijoueur ne seront pas d√©boussol√©s, chaque personnage a une capacit√© ultime activable de temps en temps. De quoi varier l√©g√®rement le gameplay. De l√† √† dire que c'est une exp√©rience pour d√©cider si cette m√©canique sera dans la campagne solo de Gears 6 aussi, il n'y a qu'un pas.Bref, si vous √™tes un grand fan de la licence, ce DLC √† bas prix vous amusera un peu, s'il ne bug pas.

Mis en avant par de nombreux streamers/youtubers, il faut dire que c'est un jeu parfait √† diffuser.Incarnant un petit bonhomme souple en forme de haricot qui a tendance √† facilement tomber, vous allez vous mesurer jusqu'√† 59 autres joueurs sur des maps aussi vari√©es que loufoques qui mettront votre √©quilibre √† rude √©preuve. De nombreux obstacles sont pr√©sents pour vous bloquer ou vous faire tomber, sans compter les nombreuses collisions avec les autres joueurs qui ne vous aideront pas dans votre ascension.Car seuls les premiers joueurs √† franchir la ligne d'arriv√©e participeront √† la manche suivante. Ainsi, de 60 joueurs max vous passerez √† 41, puis √† 29, puis √† 16, puis √† 11... Jusqu'√† ce qu'il n'en reste qu'un, qui remportant l'√©preuve finale, obtiendra une pr√©cieuse couronne pour f√™ter sa victoire.Fall Guys peut donc √™tre un jeu terriblement rageant, car il misera √† 50% sur votre skill et √† 50% sur votre chance. Vous pouvez √™tre un bon joueur en t√™te de votre manche, si le jeu d√©cide de vous chier √† la gueule en emp√™chant votre bonhomme de franchir un obstacle que pourtant, vous franchissez ais√©ment d'habitude, il le fera. Mais au moins, vous vous retrouverez rarement dans une situation identique en rejouant la m√™me map.Sans oublier les autres joueurs, qui souvent prennent un malin plaisir √† vous bloquer pour vous sucrer la qualification ou la victoire, alors que √ßa les fait perdre eux aussi... Et malheureusement, les gros d√©biles sont omnipr√©sents sur le jeu.Le jeu co√ªtait 20‚Ç¨ √† sa sortie, et offrait au joueur au fur et √† mesure de sa progression de nombreux costumes et √©l√©ments de personnalisation pour son bonhomme. Le tout gratuit, ou achetable dans la boutique avec les pi√®ces r√©colt√©es en jouant.C'√©tait donc √† ce prix, un jeu tr√®s int√©ressant. Un faible investissement, pour potentiellement des dizaines voire des centaines d'heures de jeu pour les plus patients.Jusqu'√† ce qu'Epic Games rach√®te la licence...D√©sormais, Fall Guys n'est plus disponible sur Steam mais seulement sur l'Epic Games Store. Un premier mauvais point, vu la merde instable et d√©pourvue de fonctionnalit√©s qu'est ce launcher.Injouable les jours suivants sa sortie car les serveurs √©taient HS, comme √† chaque fois avec l'EGS, le jeu est devenu free-to-play au passage. Ce qui pourrait √™tre un bon point.Mais non. Voyant l'argent facile, Epic Games a certes rendu le jeu gratuit, mais vend d√©sormais les costumes et √©l√©ments de personnalisation contre de l'argent r√©el. Si vous achetez 3 costumes, cela vous reviendra plus cher que le co√ªt initial du jeu. Des g√©nies ! Et m√™me les costumes qui √©taient obtenables GRATUITEMENT avant le rachat du jeu sont maintenant payants. Une arnaque sans nom.Quelques costumes et √©l√©ments resteront gratuits bien √©videmment, au fil et √† mesure de votre progression √† travers la saison. Pour le reste... Et bien il faudra acheter un season pass en plus.Au final, Fall Guys est devenu un jeu gratuit qui vous co√ªtera cher, et remporter la victoire n'est plus int√©ressant car ce n'est pas ce qui vous donnera le plus de points pour monter vos niveaux √† travers la saison.Retrouvez mes critiques sur ma page SensCritique ![www.senscritique.com] ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1097150,28 June,89.6,32.6

Si le but de ces derniers est de s'enfuir, celui de Rake sera de les tuer.Pour pouvoir fuir, les survivants vont devoir √©quiper une voiture en cherchant les pi√®ces manquantes √† travers la map, ou bien trouver les quelques codes diss√©min√©s √† travers la carte afin d'ouvrir un conteneur dans lequel se trouve des armes, ils pourront alors tuer le monstre et remporter la partie de cette fa√ßon. Mais il leur faudra √™tre tr√®s silencieux et furtif, car Rake entend les choses de loin, et se dirigera vers les endroits d'o√π proviennent les sons. Si les joueurs peuvent flasher le monstre les tiens, cette option n'est faisable que quelques fois, avant que mort s'ensuive si Rake vous attrape une nouvelle fois.Une fois mort, les survivants incarneront des souris, capables d'√©mettre des bruits pour induire le monstre en erreur (ou pour r√©v√©ler les autres joueurs...). Tout repose sur le son dans ce jeu. Il sera utile d'allumer des radios ou de jeter des cailloux pour √©loigner le monstre.Rake, quant √† lui, poss√®de quelques capacit√©s qui lui permettront de chasser les survivants.Si In Silence peut √™tre un bon jeu d'horreur, il souffre malheureusement de gros d√©fauts, dont le premier est sa communaut√©.

415,76561198003983097,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003983097/recommended/,Other,5,Recommended,71,3,"New World est un MMORPG qui a un fort potentiel, malheureusement g√¢ch√©, et pour qui je ne vois pas un avenir brillant. C'est fort et direct comme introduction, alors je vais t√¢cher de vous expliquer le pourquoi de ce verdict.Dans New World, aucun choix de classe ou de race n'est possible. Chaque joueur incarne un humain, et son r√¥le (tank, heal, DPS C√†C ou distance) sera d√©termin√© par le choix de ses deux armes. Que ce soit le b√¢ton de vie ou de feu, l'arc ou le mousquet ou encore la hachette, chaque arme peut atteindre le niveau 20, d√©bloquant √† chaque niveau un point de comp√©tence √† distribuer dans des comp√©tences actives ou passives. Mais seules trois comp√©tences actives peuvent √™tre choisies pour une m√™me arme, vous donnant donc acc√®s √† 6 comp√©tences au total. S'ajoute √† cela le choix de l'armure. Trois types sont disponibles : l√©ger, moyen et lourd. Les bonus et le type d'esquive diff√©reront selon votre type d'armure, et m√™me si certains builds restent pr√©d√©finis, rien n'emp√™che le joueur de faire preuve d'imagination et de se faire sa propre compo. C'est un jeu qui se veut donc facilement abordable.Trois factions sont pr√©sentes dans l'univers de New World, et se battent les unes contre les autres √† la conqu√™te de territoires. Les Engag√©s, les Maraudeurs et les Ombres devront pourtant parfois faire front commun, face √† une dangereuse menace. Attention, vous n'√™tes pas dans WoW, alors si vous vous attendez √† un lore cons√©quent, une premi√®re d√©ception vous attend. Ce n'est clairement pas pour son histoire que l'on joue √† New World, mais pour ses promesses d'un PvP omnipr√©sent et de guerres pour des territoires. Cependant, si vous vous lancez dans l'aventure principalement pour le c√¥t√© joueur contre joueur du titre, une seconde d√©ception vous attend.D'une part, nous avons le PvP sauvage. Vous pouvez activer/d√©sactiver le mode PvP lorsque vous √™tes en ville, pour ensuite partir √† la chasse aux joueurs. Vous d√©chanterez rapidement lorsque vous vous rendrez compte que vous ne croiserez que tr√®s rarement des joueurs solo, mais que vous vous ferez constamment rouler dessus par des groupes de plus de dix joueurs. Vous r√©aliserez alors que la seule fa√ßon de ""profiter"" du PvP sauvage, c'est de vous aussi rejoindre un √©norme groupe pour rouler sur les malheureux quoi croiseront votre route.C'est aussi la seule fa√ßon pour une faction de d√©clarer la guerre √† un territoire : faire un bus, prendre les qu√™tes PvP, suivre le m√™me chemin boucle apr√®s boucle pendant une heure afin de remplir la jauge d'attaque, jusqu'√† pouvoir d√©clarer la guerre. M√™me si les factions adverses feront de m√™me pour vous contrer, la faction dominante sur le territoire ne pourra pas vraiment d√©fendre, tant leur influence sur la barre d'attaque sera r√©duite.Arrive alors la guerre : un joyeux bordel √† 50 contre 50. Malheureusement, les serveurs ne tiennent pas la route, et le lag vous emp√™chera de combattre convenablement. Proposer de si grandes batailles sans pouvoir assurer que √ßa fonctionne bien, c'est quand m√™me con. De plus, ces derni√®res sont √©litistes : la guilde qui poss√®de le territoire choisira ses combattants. En clair, si vous n'√™tes pas au niveau maximum, ou si quelqu'un ne vous aime pas, vous ne combattrez jamais.De plus, le jeu se voulant facilement abordable comme je l'expliquais plus haut, cela fait que le PvP n'est pas profond, et m√™me plut√¥t limit√©.Il reste heureusement la d√©ferlante, qui est un mode de jeu domination en 20 contre 20, sans distinction de faction, et qui se r√©v√®le plut√¥t sympathique.L'aspect PvE est lui plus r√©ussi. Atteindre le niveau maximum (qui est 60) se fait facilement car chaque action donne de l'exp√©rience, et obtenir un √©quipement haut niveau n'est pas bien dur. Vous tournerez donc vite en rond, car ce ne sont pas les quelques donjons que le jeu propose qui vous permettront une certaine rejouabilit√©, ni les diff√©rentes qu√™tes du jeu.Il reste les invasions, qui sont l'√©quivalent des guerres mais en PvE. Cette fois, la s√©lection des joueurs se fera diff√©remment. La guilde qui contr√¥le le territoire attaqu√© ne pourra choisir que 10 joueurs, les 40 autres seront d√©termin√©s al√©atoirement. Si cela permettait aux gens de pouvoir avoir une chance de participer √† du contenu haut niveau, ce n'est en fait pas si s√ªr, car durant les quinze minutes de pr√©paration pr√©c√©dant l'invasion, la guilde qui contr√¥le pourra exclure des joueurs, en esp√©rant qu'un autre plus ""int√©ressant"" soit s√©lectionn√©. En gros, ils peuvent faire en sorte de faire passer les copains.Le fait que des territoires puissent √™tre contr√¥l√©s directement par les joueurs offre une m√©canique int√©ressante au jeu, la gestion de l'√©conomie. Lorsque vous mettez des objets en vente √† l'h√¥tel des ventes, que vous fabriquerez des objets ou si vous poss√©dez une maison, diverses taxes appliqu√©es par la guilde qui contr√¥le la zone s'appliqueront. L'argent r√©col√© par les taxes servira ensuite √† am√©liorer la ville pour permettre aux joueurs d'avoir acc√®s √† des objets de plus haut niveau pour leur m√©tier, mais aussi pour la d√©fense de la ville lors des guerres et des invasions. Il est dommage que ce point puisse √™tre ruin√© par la communaut√©, j'y viendrais ensuite.Qui dit MMO, dit farming. Comme New World permet √† ses joueurs d'utiliser l'int√©gralit√© de tous les m√©tiers que le jeu propose, vous vous doutez que vous allez passer pas mal de temps √† cueillir, couper du bois, fabriquer des armes et j'en passe. Force est d'admettre que le farm dans New World est bien amen√©. Les ressources relient les m√©tiers entre eux, rendant la chose plus sympathique √† d√©couvrir et √† faire.Maintenant je vais aborder les deux points les plus n√©gatifs du jeu. Premi√®rement, les bugs. Il y en a √©norm√©ment, et ces derniers ont un impact fort et n√©gatif sur des aspects importants du titre comme le PvP ou l'√©conomie. Par exemple, √† l'heure o√π j'√©cris ces lignes il existe un bug qui permet √† la faction attaquante de gagner une guerre en seulement quelques minutes. Un autre a fait que les joueurs pouvaient dupliquer des objets et de l'argent, obligeant l'√©quipe de d√©veloppement √† bloquer l'h√¥tel des ventes et les √©changes. Des bugs concernant aussi les armes, rendant certaines totalement inefficaces en combat, alors que d'autres sont devenues extr√™mement mortelles.Deuxi√®mement, sa communaut√©. C'est lorsque l'on joue √† New World que l'on se dit qu'un MMO qui demande un abonnement mensuel, ce n'est pas forc√©ment une mauvaise chose. Cela permet de faire un tri, et d'√©viter d'avoir une communaut√© enti√®rement toxique.Car malheureusement, celle de New World est un cancer en phase terminale. Les canaux de discussions sont infest√©s de trolls, les insultes y fusent sans arr√™t, tout comme le trashtalk et les d√©bats idiots montrant toute absence intellectuelle chez certains. Si vous vous lancez dans le jeu, un conseil : masquez le tchat.Mais les choses ne s'arr√™tent malheureusement pas aux seules discussions. Comme New World propose un gameplay qui donne du pouvoir aux joueurs, vous allez avoir √† faire aux pires comportements possibles en jeu. Vous vous doutez que l'exploitation des bugs se fait √† outrance, les guildes qui ont du pouvoir n'h√©sitent parfois pas √† en abuser, celles qui n'ont pas de pouvoir n'h√©sitent parfois pas √† saboter la d√©fense des autres (alors qu'elles combattent pour la m√™me faction.). Il est aussi courant que le chef d'une guilde qui poss√®de un ou plusieurs territoires vole l'argent g√©n√©r√© par les taxes avant de fuir en d√©truisant la guilde, laissant un ou des territoires sans contr√¥le, cela ayant un impact n√©gatif sur l'influence de la faction et l'√©conomie.Bon, terminons au moins sur une note positive : l'OST du jeu est superbe. Malgr√© tout, je recommande ce jeu, car il reste possible de s'amuser entre amis, et si vous ne jouez pas avec de grosses attentes.Retrouvez mes critiques sur SensCritique ![www.senscritique.com] ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1063730,19 June,047.4,195.2

Non pas parce qu'elle est mauvaise. Il est agr√©able d'incarner Randall, personnage tortur√© √©voluant dans un monde post-apocalyptique. Mais parce qu'elle ne casse pas trois pattes √† un canard. M√™me si elle est agr√©able √† suivre, en grande partie gr√¢ce √† la belle direction artistique du jeu, elle reste pr√©visible et peu originale.Si un jeu comme Limbo a pu vous plaire, Deadlight devrait vous int√©resser. Bien qu'il soit plus facile, beaucoup plus facile. M√™me le mode cauchemar qui vous oblige √† faire le jeu d'une traite sans mourir, au risque de tout reprendre depuis le d√©but, ne donne pas tant de challenge que √ßa. √Ä vrai dire, la seule chose qui vous tuera dans ce jeu est la lourdeur du personnage qui fait qu'il ratera par moments certaines actions. Des actions que vous r√©p√©tez pourtant sans arr√™t... Jusqu'au moment o√π le jeu vous dira merde, non, cette fois √ßa marchera pas, prend √ßa dans ta gueule. C'est un peu frustrant. Tr√®s frustrant en fait... Idem pour les combats. Parfois il sera facile de vous sortir de l'emprise d'un zombie, puis la fois suivante vous n'y parviendrez pas, sans raison apparente.Qui dit jeu de plateforme en 2D dit ""puzzle"". Pour avancer, il va falloir vous creuser les m√©ninges. Mais il ne sera pas n√©cessaire d'avoir un QI sup√©rieur √† 130 pour s'en sortir. Deadlight est un jeu qui se prend tr√®s facilement en mains, par son gameplay simpliste mais aussi par la facilit√© de ses √©nigmes. Le jeu ne vous demandera pas de creuser en profondeur, lorsque vous √™tes bloquer quelque part, la solution se trouve forc√©ment √† quelques pas de vous. Il ne sera jamais n√©cessaire d'avancer pour revenir sur ses pas ensuite afin de pouvoir continuer par exemple. Et si de nombreux passages peuvent vous surprendre et offrir une mort instantan√©e, √ßa n'en fait pas pour autant un v√©ritable die & retry. Je le r√©p√®te, mais le jeu est vraiment simple alors si vous mourez plusieurs fois de suite au m√™me endroit, c'est que le probl√®me se situe entre la chaise et le clavier.

Comme il s'agit ici d'un remaster, je vais juste aborder les points du jeu qui √©voluent, m√™me si c'est un bien grand mot. Car comme mon titre l'indique, nous avons √† faire √† un remaster fain√©ant.Pour celles et ceux qui ne le savent pas ou qui m√©langent les termes, une remasterisation est une refonte d'un jeu. Ce peut √™tre d'un point de vu graphique ou concernant le gameplay directement.C'est ce que la logique veut en tout cas. Mais pas ici. D√©j√†, vous pouvez oublier une am√©lioration du gameplay, il n'y en a pas. Le contr√¥le du personnage est identique √† l'ancien titre, ce qui est dommage car sans √™tre ignoble, on ne peut pas dire que ses mouvements sont fluides.Par contre j'ai rencontr√© un bug r√©current, que je n'avais pas dans l'ancien titre. Si avec Ghostbusters: The Video Game il arrivait de rares fois qu'un fant√¥me se bloque dans le d√©cor. Ici, les fant√¥mes se bloquent tr√®s souvent hors de port√©e. Ils sont l√†, vous balancent des merdes, mais ils restent immobiles et vous ne pouvez les atteindre...Vous compterez alors sur l'IA, qui n'est pas meilleure qu'auparavant, pour r√©ussir ce qui est impossible pour vous : faire revenir ce foutu fant√¥me sur le terrain !Bon par contre ne r√™vez pas, vos co√©quipiers sont toujours aussi lents pour vous relever lorsque vous √™tes √† terre du coup comme avant, ils ne r√©ussiront pas √† venir vers vous sans se faire mettre √† terre aussi, vous obligeant √† reprendre au dernier checkpoint.La seule ""am√©lioration"" que vous trouverez concerne les graphismes. Mais mis √† part le fait que ce remaster est jouable en 4K √† 60fps, la refonte est douce, comme le prouve cette vid√©o comparative.Je le recommande tout de m√™me car √ßa reste un plaisir de d√©couvrir le tr√®s bon sc√©nario offert par ce jeu qui reste quand m√™me tr√®s agr√©able dans son ensemble. Et comme j'ai pu le dire pour le titre initial, il ravira les fans de la licence. Mais si vous avez le titre initial justement, vous n'aurez pas besoin de celui-ci. Si ce n'est pas le cas cependant, attendez une baisse de prix. Il co√ªte 21‚Ç¨ mais se retrouve souvent en promo √† 5‚Ç¨.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1449280,"10 March, 2021",8.8,4.0
418,76561198003983097,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003983097/recommended/,Other,2,Recommended,3,0,"Temtem est un Pok√©mon-like qui vous fait r√©aliser ce que vous attendez dans un jeu Pok√©mon. Car si Temtem est aussi enfantin dans son histoire que son concurrent direct et propose un contenu identique, ce jeu est cependant bien plus difficile et offre des √©l√©ments que l'on attend dans chaque nouveau jeu Pok√©mon.Le syst√®me de base est familier : vous √™tes un gosse pr√™t √† partir √† la chasse aux Temtems. Pour d√©buter votre aventure, le scientifique de votre ville vous offre votre premier Temtem, que vous choisirez selon les trois qu'il vous propose. Un autre gamin est pr√©sent, qui se r√©v√®le √™tre votre rival. D'ailleurs, il vous mettra une branl√©e direct apr√®s. Le message est clair : les combats ne seront pas si simples, on y reviendra. Ainsi commence l'histoire principale, qui aura une dur√©e de vie allant jusqu'√† 50 heures. Vous ferez face √† un clan aux plans machiav√©liques, pourrez capturer 164 Temtems diff√©rents, combattrez 8 ma√Ætres de dojo... √áa ne vous rappelle rien ?Mais Temtem propose aussi son lot de qu√™tes secondaires, qui vous m√®neront par-ci par-l√† √† travers les diff√©rentes √Æles que propose le monde afin d'accomplir des objectifs divers et vari√©s. Et le tout jouable enti√®rement en coop√©ration !Vivre une aventure de ce genre avec un ami est ce que tout fan de Pok√©mon attend depuis toujours. C'est un r√©el plaisir, et permet de pimenter les combats. Car comme dit plus haut, ces derniers ne sont pas simples. Chaque combat se joue en 2 contre 2. Si en solo, vous aurez une √©quipe de 6 Temtems et en enverrez deux en m√™me temps, en coop√©ration chacun des joueurs enverra un Temtem au combat, et utilisera au total 3 Temtems de son √©quipe. Si chaque Temtem a un ou deux types, permettant donc des r√©sistances ou des faiblesses, peut apprendre 4 attaques, peut tenir un objet et poss√®de un trait qui lui est propre, il aura une barre d'√©nergie. Cette derni√®re se videra au fur et √† mesure de vos attaques, et si jamais elle est vide, alors votre Temtem sacrifiera de sa vie pour attaquer, avant d'√™tre √©reint√© pendant un tour. Cela donne une autre dimension aux combats, et permet alors un v√©ritable challenge. De plus, certaines attaques peuvent profiter d'une synergie, c'est-√†-dire que l'attaque sera plus puissante si le Temtem combattant aux c√¥t√©s de l'attaquant est du type d√©sir√© par la synergie. Et croyez-moi, les dresseurs qui seront sur votre route jouent sur la synergie et sur les types pour √™tre plus efficaces.Le PvP √©tant bien √©videmment possible, vous vous doutez que les combats comp√©titifs peuvent prendre une ampleur √©norme.Ainsi, pour monter une √©quipe parfaite, il vous faudra faire preuve de patience et capturer des Temtems ayant de bonnes statistiques. Ces derni√®res sont au nombre de 7, et peuvent profiter de bonus via les CA et les CP. Chaque statistique peut avoir un montant maximum de 50 CA, ce qui donnera 25 points bonus √† la stat concern√©e. Pour obtenir ce montant, il faut soit capturer des Temtems ayant 50 points de base dans une ou plusieurs statistiques, utiliser des objets ou les faire se reproduire. Ce point est aussi plus approfondi que dans Pok√©mon, on y vient juste apr√®s. Les CP quant √† eux peuvent √™tre de 500 maximum dans une stat, et chaque Temtem ne peut avoir plus de 1000 CP. 7 CP donnent un point dans la statistique concern√©e, ainsi un Temtem peut avoir 71 points bonus dans deux statistiques ! Pour augmenter le nombre de CP, il faudra faire combattre son Temtem face √† des Temtems sauvages sp√©cifiques, qui donneront quelques points √† une stat pr√©cise.Je vous laisse imaginer le temps que √ßa peut prendre... Si en plus vous voulez que votre Temtem soit luma (l'√©quivalent de shiny), il vous faudra √©norm√©ment de chance en prime !Pour vous aider dans l'obtention des 50 CA par statistique, la reproduction est possible. En faisant s'accoupler un Temtem m√¢le et un Temtem femelle, vous pourrez transmettre aux b√©b√©s des attaques, des traits et les CA tant d√©sir√©s. Mais cela n'est pas sans condition. Pour que deux Temtems puissent se reproduire, ils doivent √™tre jumeaux ou partager un m√™me type. Sachant que si les deux ne sont pas identiques, le Temtem √† na√Ætre sera de la lign√©e √©volutive de la m√®re. De plus, chaque Temtem ne peut se reproduire que 8 fois maximum, et cela baissera au fur et √† mesure de vos reproductions. Ainsi, la capture de nouveaux Temtems sera n√©cessaire si vous n'arrivez pas √† obtenir votre compagnon parfait rapidement.Si depuis quelques ann√©es les jeux Pok√©mon permettent d'habiller votre personnage, Temtem le propose aussi. Mais que ce soit cela ou la cr√©ation de personnage, √ßa reste du basique malheureusement. Par contre, si le visage de votre personnage semble normal, les visages des PNJ sont affreux. Ils sont plats, sans reliefs. Ce qui leur donne un air ahuri...Par contre, vous pouvez vous acheter une maison et la d√©corer. √áa n'apporte rien, mais on adore √ßa !Un contenu endgame permet √† plusieurs joueurs de rejoindre une antre tous ensemble. Ils devront alors se frayer un chemin jusqu'√† la fin de celle-ci, en combattant et en r√©cup√©rant des ressources, avant d'avoir √† combattre ensemble un Temtem mythique. Ce qui permet d'obtenir le Temtem en question, ainsi que des r√©compenses sp√©ciales.En bref, Temtem propose ce que les jeux Pok√©mon ont aussi, mais de mani√®re plus approfondie et sans vous tenir la main tout du long pour faciliter les choses tout en apportant des aspects in√©dits au genre. Mais √† la diff√©rence que le jeu est encore en acc√®s anticip√©, et que du nouveau contenu est d'ores et d√©j√† pr√©vu. Prochaine √©tape : l'ajout de montures !Par contre on regrettera le choix de l'√©criture inclusive. Lire des conneries comme ""iel"" ou ""maon"", c'est d'une d√©bilit√© sans nom.Retrouvez toutes mes critiques sur ma page SensCritique.[www.senscritique.com] ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/745920,12 March,59.0,39.0

Je veux dire, bien que ce ne soit pas un jeu qui a pour vocation de narrer des l√©gendes de son univers, √©norm√©ment de cr√©ations de fan ont pris de l'ampleur, au point de devenir des romans ou des bande-dessin√©es.Mais c'est toujours plut√¥t enfantin...

The gameplay is fantastic and all of the voice commentary is taken from actual NBA games so it makes it feel very real. However, if you are a HUGE fan of playing the NBA All-Star weekend, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!The dunk contest controls are absolutely awful. Guitar Hero controls make absolutely no sense whatsoever in terms of replicating the feel of someone completing a slam dunk. Further, the controls were meant to be ""fun friendly"", for casual gamers to pick up and succeed. In contrast, I actually found completing a dunk and winning a contest in 2K13 was much more difficult in both regards than its predecessors found in previous 2K's. And again, at no point do we ever feel we're in control of what's happening on the court. Absolutely no correlation.The 3pt. Contest was just incredibly clunky. There was, in fact, a shooting groove to be found. But, under no circumstances do I feel a gamer's lack of ability to find a groove should be punished with complete controller unresponsiveness. In short, the mode offered virtually no fun, just frustration and confusion.In summary I only recommend this game if you don't care about the NBA All-Star weekend, if that aspect doesn't interest you then this game is absolutely amazing, if they can fix this for future games then it would be near perfect.

Now that it's on steam I've finally had a chance to give it a shot, and so far, it is living up to it's promises. although there are still issues here and there. The dev team has released it in early access as such. In fact, from all of the correspondence from the devs it seems that they did not plan on releasing on Steam this early, but had to to keep being able to generate keys for the game from steam for supporters. So the devs seem to understand that the game is no where near a final state yet, and are working on it.That being said, what is already here is very solid. The AI can actually do a lot. And although there are issues and changes, the AI is definitely there. The gameplay is also already quite solid, with multiple approaches to situations.

I can very much recommend. It creates a fantastic world and universe around your characters, and the closest videogame comparison I can find being something like divinity original sin with world-building. Another great comparison is DnD, it's like a DnD game, but with pre-made art and scripts which do genuinely give depth to the customizable characters.I along with a group of friends who also picked up the game in the Jingle Jam, decided to jump on and give it a shot, and in the past 2 days we've played about 8 hours, and completed one of the campaigns in the game.

With each of us taking on the role of our character, and reading off the lines in the fully illustrated stories, as well as just having general fun with splitting loot and fighting for the controls at times.

Just for some background; at it's core, It Takes Two is a story-driven, 2-player co-op puzzle game, with game-play that genuinely never stops changing. The main game is split into 'chapters' where each chapter let's you play around and solve puzzles with different gadgets. As well as sometimes throwing completely different types of games at you ranging from street fighter to rhythm game.

Once you make it beyond the belltower bomb explosion (first 45 minutes of the game), the confusing open world aspect kicks-in.I think the combat, upgrades, etc could be interesting if you can make sense of the game enough to get there.I may try to push through the game in the future.

As of right now i have 3 hours in the game therefore the review won't be too long but I still want to make the devs aware of some stuff that I found some very funny some a bit game breaking because you can soft lock. The first thing I noticed and found pretty funny is that if you jump on a barrel or explosive barrel they just shrink or fall under the map. The second thing it's a bit more serious. The best way to describe this is with 2 solid examples. In the first map as you stay up on the platform with the flames coming out of the floor that you can shoot fall in the kitchen area, and in front of you the big blue door; Look the the right and head to the stairs, for some reason a very weird thing happens when your character wants to fall down from a platform to another and it gets stuck in a invisible wall or smt. You can't get out of it (I tried ). In the second map; there is this secret on the roof top for which you have to go to the tower structure do some parkour jumps. When you jump from a platform to another your character gets stuck on the platform they are already on and therefore making it hard to jump or remain stuck there. I think those were the main issues I found HOWEVER with all of these being said the game is still amazing; if you look at the demo and the first map side by side ; you can see how much love and effort was put into this game. The secrets may seem a bit complicated but they are very rewarding. The mechanics and gameplay evolved so much from the first game and in my opinion it's really fun. That doesn't mean you shouldn't check out the first game as well; it's a really good game. P.S: the fully automatic shotgun combine with the Q power up (the one that gives you the weapon in the other hand as well ) makes my day better.

The game itself works alright ; with smooth movement and actions ; but it just doesn‚Äôt feel the same. Why ? because the main Katana from what I played so far ; it is 100% useless no matter what upgrades I put on it ; the weapons that I got weren‚Äôt ‚Äúdeserved‚Äù (like in the first game) ;I  just bought them with in-game money from Larry and put those ‚Äúrune ‚Äú type items on them to give them special effects and a little bit of damage buff. The enemies have quite an interesting design ; but  why do they need to have a health bar ? why don‚Äôt they just die when you shoot them with a shotgun for example or slash them with the Katana ; again just like in the first game. Perhaps it‚Äôs because of the co-op aspect of the game but even so ; why not implement this feature in the ‚Äúmultiplayer ‚Äú section only ; since there is an option to play singleplayer as well as multiplayer . When it comes down to the map design ; the places are beautiful all into their own way from the forests ; to temples ; to towns ; to the cyberpunk city and to the little secret areas ; some of the secret areas being full of Easter eggs and references and umm... holograms ... yeeess .Into the story I didn‚Äôt manage to progress as much as I would like to ; but so far it seems decent ; with a little bit of throwback to the Shadow Warrior 1 game .Ratings:The one and only Wang : 10/10 Enemies: 8.2/10Gameplay: 8/10 Weapons : 6/10 (I get it ; there are a lot of weapons but what for ; it‚Äôs not as complex as in the first game ; plus they murdered the main Katana ) Storyline: ---/10 (I will update when I will finish the game ) All and all ; the game in my opinion shouldn't be called Shadow Warrior ; it‚Äôs a nice and fun game that you can play with your friends ; again NOT as a shadow warrior game but more like a run and gun game (from what I experienced so far ; if  somehow  the game will manage to change as I progress deeper into the storyline then perhaps but until then it‚Äôs not even close to a shadow warrior game ) P.S: please don‚Äôt make anymore shadow warrior games by taking so much inspiration from the Borderlands ; I get that Shadow Warrior 1 as well as Borderlands (all of them ) are indeed great games ; but let‚Äôs not combine them and call it Shadow Warrior 2.  ,https://steamcommunity.com/app/324800,"16 June, 2019",7.5,7.5

I love deck building games and this has some of that element. It is an easy game to learn but offers a fair challenge once you feel you have a clear understanding of the card combos you can achieve through the various faction pairs. A 'Run Through' (Game) consists of 6 or 7 sections with your chosen faction pair. Each section allows you to boost/buff your deck with a new artifact, new card, or new card enhancements. Then you 'fight' to proceed to the next section until you reach a final Boss section. New cards are unlocked along the way (win or lose). A game like this is perfect and relaxing for me while I am listening to a book or when I may be called away at a moment for work or other. Easily my favorite game of 2020 thus far.

This is a Dungeon crawler of sorts that centers on building the Talent Pool (card pool) of a Character Type rather than the individual character. So a character you named -Conan--who is a Barbarian- will die but now the next Barbarians that spawn will have more cards to use in the next Dungeon. The game will seem a bit difficult in the beginning but you will learn how to use the cards to your characters benefit.When I started playing I wasn't sure until I understood that failing a dungeon actually helps you grow your deck pool. So basically 5-10 minutes and I was hooked for over 80 Hours of play. If you have trouble enjoying the game in the beginning it is probably because -like me- you want your characters to live.

While I wouldn't say it breaks the 4th wall extremely well or gives the player meaningfull choices that they regret later. It takes a different perspective on war and what being a soldier is really like. Don't get me wrong, you're still an andrenaline fuelled tank effortlessly mowing down soldiers, but instead of you being completely sure that you are doing the right thing, there are hints thrown in that make you question wether what you're doing is right. Not to mention the incredible finale that you have to experience for yourself.This game definitely shows that even when the protagonist is essentially a god you can still craft a copelling and memorable narrative around him.

I did the latter, reason for why I am saying this? Well it seems that some people have buggy AI that keeps running out of cover and dying. PhysX might have something to do with it, I ain't an expert though. For me the AI works just like in ant other game where you have AI companions, yes they have suicidal tendencies, but I never felt like they were constanly running Into enemy fire and I was playing on the ""hard"" difficulty. It is certainly tough at the start, when you aren't acustomes to the main focus of combat, which are the abilities that your soldiers have. I felt like the world was stacked against me when I started the game, but 2-3 hours in I noticed that I only died to stupid mistakes, rather than the AI acting dumb. In fact I only lost one soldier throughout the campaign and that was in my first hour when I still didn't quite get the abilities.Personally being a big fan of these strategy and shooter hybrids, I really enjoyed the campaign and certainly wouldn't say that this isn't worth 15‚Ç¨.

I personally would say that the game is definitely worth it even without the mods that are offered by Open IV, but removing them is a low blow and this is why I can't push myself to recommend this game, because this decision might come back later to haunt the player in the GTA V universe. Lucky for us, that day is not today.Open IV was a popular tool that a lot of modders used to make their mods for GTA V. Note that the developer of Open IV himself had to confirm that the mod/tweak DOESN'T allow you to CHEAT online. If the game was modded, GTA ONLINE simply WOULDN'T LAUNCH.Both Take Two and Rockstar used cheaters as an excuse for taking down this tool, because it is bad for their shark card business. If you have a game that is modded to ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•, why would you play online? You have fun in single player, so you won't get into the grindfest that is GTA online. Take Two and Rockstar know that and they have ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• excuse to ban the tool.TotalBiscuit made a great video talking about this and even comparing the decision to Bethesda's creator club.https://youtu.be/8hLmM6pK0wg?t=28m33s ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/271590,"24 November, 2017",423.6,106.5

This game...I just finished the game and the extra chapter and let me tell you... The story is so ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• complicated, that even after playing through it one more time. I still don't understand wtf is going on. ""The Last Chapter"" (so is the free dlc called) helps uncovers some more story behind the main character Sgt. Burden and I would even compare the depht of the story to other devolver digital title ""Hotline Miami"", they both have a story that when finished makes you cofused as hell and realised that you did all of what you did, for nothing basically. This game more leans for existential crisis, thinking of how little you mean in the vast universe.So now to the gameplay and holy $hit this game is hard on the original difficulty. I being a dude that always picks ""normal"" when it comes to game difficulty, am a stubborn bastard and learn to adapt to the game in order to win, but this game has bested me and I had to lower the difficulty of it, just to barely manage beating it. Now if you hate the RNG this game also has a ""puzzle"" mode that bypasses as much of rng as possible, to provide you with a more of a puzzle rather than strategy feel. But it ain't just a generic point & click, but rather more of a strategy game on original mode having you manage various resources and people, trying to ensure your survival (in this game most of the people are expendable)So if you enjoy games that are harder than balls of steel, then this game is for you, just pick a mode that suits you and roll. Also if you're a story type of guy (like me) then this game is also for you, since they even have a ""narrative"" mode that is like COD and let's you skim through the challenges with ease (It took me ~1hr to beat the game on narrative mode after beating it on original light which took me ~5hrs and a wish to kill myself from all the tries.)

The game is free to play or should I say was free because the game ends its life by the end of May 2022. I decided to come back to the game for its remaining days and I am super disappointed. Let me start with what I find the most frustrating about this game and these are campers. The community of this game is awful. The majority of playerbase is to no one's surprise from Russia. Russian communities tend to be toxic and this is exactly the case in this situation. Beside that everyone, EVERY SINGLE PLAYER is camping like crazy. I have yet to meet a player in this game that isn't hidden behind a corner or a tree. This combined with terrible visibility makes the game really frustrating to play. Don't get me wrong, I find the graphical side of this game incredibly good but I don't think it goes well with a genre like this one. Let's move to pay to win aspect of the game. The game has faction system. To get better gear you have to grind one of 4 factions and once you level up you have access to a bit better items. These new items aren't much better than the ones you had unlocked a level before. If you want to level up one faction to the maximum it should take you at least a few hundred hours. You can also just purchase items of higher levels in a shop for special currency that is only obtainable by real money. The gear you can buy gives you even better statistics and bonuses than the items from maxed out faction. It doesn't even make the grind worth it. Players who put few hundred hours into the game will still be on the disadventage against a player who spent real money. It's pathetic.What is also worth mentioning is bots. These guys have aimbot, wallhack and other similar things. You might even be behind one and start shooting at it but you are likely to die first anyway. They will just quickly turn around and kill you within half a second. You don't have to play bot games to find one. They are also on official servers taking free spots which are reserved for the players. Playing with or against bots is a complete opposite of fun in this game.Another thing I wanted to mention is achievements. Good 90% of them require either hundreds of hours, luck or cheats. These are not well written achievements. Let me give you an example: win a game with 50 kills and 0 deaths or have a game with 75 kills. These are only obtainable on an online match against players. I have tried to have it done with bots as well as on custom match I hosted to no result. Its impossible to get unless the whole enemy team is afk or you are cheating. Now with the game shutting down its servers, we are going to be stuck with these achievements for good, being unable to complete them. That's the scenario for us unless developers actually remove these achievements, but I wouldn't hope for it. They are well-known for not listening to their playerbase.In my opinion the game from mechanical and graphical side is great but I wouldn't recommend it. Unappealing community and achievements have definitely ruined the game for me. My ingame experience has also been mostly negative. I m glad that the game is dying and I regret playing it.

We idle while our hero and his team of 4 marcenaries are going through groups of monsters and levels. That's how we progress.At first glance, the game looks very nice and different from other clicker games, but in reality it is not. Everything is based on rewinding time, which resets your progress. In other games this is optional, and unfortunately it is required to unlock newer options in this game, which is a big minus for me personally.Everything is fine until we reach level 270 and we have to fight boss named Eve. To kill this boss all we need to do is to use mechanics of the game and only then we are able to see how much the mechanics of the game doesn't work properly. The game is very poorly written and the mechanics do not work as they should.While progressing through further levels, we can encounter other players and we are forced to fight them. I don't like this feature and it gets annoying over time. Players should not be forced into pvp, if they dont want to. Pvp should be optional and it is not, especially in a clicker game. It takes a lot of time and the rewards are not even that good. It is a waste of time.Another unappealing thing is sprint, which is a two-day race to the highest level possible in exchange for prizes. Why unappealing? Because the game is pay2win and spending real money gives you a huge advantage over others, so racing is pointless if you don't want to pay. If that wasn't enough, developers came up with a great idea that for finishing the race at at least top 20 position there is an achievement. So if you are achievement hunter, it's best for you to avoid this game, because reaching the top 20 is a miracle, unless you want to spend real money or two whole days of your life.Of course, the game is free and definitely worth trying, but unfortunately due to the things I listed above I cannot recommend the game. It was mostly a negative experience for me.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/840260,30 July,34.5,34.5

At the launch out of early access in June 2019, the game had a competent start for a low-profile shooter with nearly 10,000 CCU. That number has since dropped to about a tenth of what it once was.As its playerbase spirals downward (leaving certain regions dead), most people who are still left defending Battalion 1944 say it will ""get better"" after they ship some updates from their roadmap. They mention that support will continue for ""years to come."" The CEO of the developer, Bulkhead, routinely posts on reddit to reaffirm that they are focused on squashing bugs and shipping content. They should be; the game is caught in a trajectory similar to that of 2017's notorious blunder Lawbreakers.On more than one occasion, however, the developer not only refuses to take consumer issues seriously, but passive aggressively attacks them for criticizing the game. Hit registration problems and unreliable anti-cheat are two hot topics in the Battalion 1944 community, and posts by users on the subreddit that discuss these issues (among others) have historically been locked or deleted at the request of the developer. The CEO gave up his moderation rights on the subreddit recently to comply with the site's EULA, but his tone whenever he posts has not changed: ""we're not trying to deny these problems exist, we just don't want factually incorrect information to spread.""Bulkhead are quick to defend their actions by saying users are spreading ""false information."" The problem with this approach is that, as the developer, you are permanently inserting your professional opinion that the issue has been looked into and decided upon. Users are now far less likely to look for ways to fix such basic issues as hit registration *for your benefit* because of the continual vilification of such discussion on the Battalion 1944 subreddit. Any healthy developer of a healthy game would react very differently. They would try to silently alter the conversation by trying to reproduce what users are talking about and fixing the issues they detect. The most useful conversations your users can have, Bulkhead, are those that they have when they think you are not there. If the problem exists, fix it; don't tell users how to discuss it. It will make the game harder to fix if your users are afraid to talk about problems.Time and time again, the CEO of Bulkhead will insist that hacking reports and bugs should be reported via e-mail instead of posted on reddit. Perhaps it is a more useful way to message the developers, but any good developer understands that they are serving the consumer and not the other way around. Posting problems on reddit is the new normal. We use reddit because the public nature allows significant issues to get a lot more visible traction that developers can then clearly see the impact of. If a lot of people comment on one issue versus another, they know where their priorities should be. If you don't like that, tough. If you're afraid of bad press, then fix the game instead of telling users to keep the problems to channels where they can't be picked up on by potential buyers or journalists. At this point, even if the game somehow makes a miraculous comeback and becomes legitimately popular, I will still struggle to support a developer like Bulkhead. It is clear that they are very actively concerned with message control surrounding Battalion 1944's very glaring issues. Instead of putting their heads down and working on them, however, they continue to tell their userbase how to behave to put up a front of success even as the CCU dwindles. Their flippant, frequent stubbornness is anti-consumer and has no place in video games. I regret my purchase.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/489940,"17 August, 2019",96.5,93.6

 ¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†·êÅ ·êÅ ·êÅ full review below ·êÅ ·êÅ ·êÅMonster Hunter World has been around for a while now on PC (and even longer on consoles) but with a new incoming expansion (Iceborne) and the price dropping I thought a review might help some people decide if the game was for them.The player take the role of a hunter recruited by the 5th fleet, and aided by a handler and a trusty Palico assistant (basically a little cat helper). You are tasked by The Research Commission to travel to the New World to study the activities of  Elder Dragons (tremendously powerful monsters on a truly massive scale). Character customisation is good with lots of options and you can even customise your Palico.The game may appear a little complex at first but once you have played for a while the basics will become very familiar. The formula is essentially this:- Obtain a quest from the mission board in the Headquarters, these will typically be to either kill or capture a large monster, kill a number of smaller monsters or collect a number of items around the map.- Optionally stock up on items that will aid you on the hunt and have a meal that will boost your stats.- Gather up your party or head off solo to the area on the map the quest is set in.- Use your scout flies to find the monsters tracks and follow them until you find the monster- Batter the monster over the head (or weakspot) with your oversized weapon until they die or run away. If they run away repeat the step above.- Harvest the monster for materials which can be used back at the Forge to make better armour and weapons.Capturing monsters involves creating traps and tranquillisers, damaging a monster sufficiently (until they are limping and low health), luring the monster into the trap and then using the tranquillisers to knock it unconscious. This can be done on both capture and hunt quests.Large monsters are pretty varied and will change depending on the area of map your in - Giant lizards (Jagras), Fire breathing T-Rexs (Anjanath), Giant electric squirrels (Tobi-kadachi), Dragons (Rathian), Inflatable Albino bats (Paolumu) to list just a few you will meet at the start (there are many many more). The more you track a monster the more info you will find out about them (information becomes available in your monster field guide), each has its own set of weak spots and each has its own set of resistances and vulnerabilities. To be most effective, hunters should use appropriate equipment for the monster they are going to battle. (for example having armour that is highly resistant to fire and a weapon that deals water damage when facing the fire breathing Anjanath)Map areas are grouped by biome (Ancient Forest, Desert, a Cora landscape, etc)  and each have a very different aesthetic, plants and wildlife. Bugs an smaller creatures can be caught in your net to craft potions or items later, some can even be kept as pets in your room. Mushrooms, seeds and plants can be harvested, you can catch fish with your net or rod and bait, you can explore and find quests, new campsites and hidden areas. Each location is made up of a number of different zones seamlessly connected together and which you can travel between and explore freely. Levels have quite a lot of verticality and complexity and I often times find myself getting turned around or lost (but perhaps that's just me!) There are 14 main weapon types in the game each with their own style and abilities, each of these types then has many different variants which can be crafted using materials collected and harvested during missions. There is also huge array of different armour (for you and your Palico) which can be crafted at the forge, each has its own set of armour values, elemental resistances and bonuses, as you progress through the game and fight more monsters more of these armour sets and weapons will become available. I would recommend testing out the different weapons in the sparing area until you find one that suites your playstyle (also don't be afraid of swapping around either).I've given you some of basics but its really only scratching the surface, this game has a massive depth to it which really helps considering a few of its flaws. The Grind, you will in Monster Hunter World need to fight the same type of monsters quite a number of times before you are able to progress onto a stronger monster (especially if solo). This is to increase your hunters level and also to gather the required materials to craft new sets of armour, weapons and items you will need against stronger foes. Until you learn a monsters attack pattern you may well have a hard time avoiding attacks which can be powerful (rage attacks) with certain monsters and cause you to faint (sometimes in one hit if under geared and under powered). Due to the way this works this can sometimes create something of a progress wall (my first was the Anjanath) where you feel overpowered against the weaker monsters but get utterly trashed by the stronger ones. If you meet one of these either find a good team to support you or upgrade your equipment to best suit the fight and learn the attack pattern, you will get through eventually!Graphics are good, even better with the free HD texture pack, I would recommend using reshade (guides are available) if colours are a little washed out, that and turning off motion blur. Lip syncing in cut scenes for English is absurd but easily overlooked.Playing a mission in 4 player coop (max 16 in session, max 4 per mission) is a lot of fun, and I would recommend coop as the way to play the game, however there is an issue with coop and the story campaign. For some reason (best known to themselves) Capcom require players to first play a story mission through until the end of the cut sequences / start of the battle before other players can join them in coop. This often means to play a story mission coop you need all players to start the quest, play until the battle, abandon the quest and then restart in coop mode, its quite absurd but possible to work around. However story missions are only part of the game and arena quests, optional quests, events and investigations do not have this issue. In addition to quests you can free roam the different biomes in expedition mode, but to do this in coop you first need to complete a quest with your team and all select return to camp.Well done if you've managed to read this far, honestly there is so much more I haven't covered in this review and more still I have yet to explore in the game but I hope this review has given you a feel for the game and some of the basics. Despite a few flaws this game remains a thoroughly enjoyable experience, particularly for coop play and I would highly recommend it.Agree / Disagree with anything in this review?

Everything from the characters you meet, the decor of buildings, the white 80's suits of the enemies to your car are all extremely well done and all add to the 80's Miami feel.   Audio 9 Game music and effects are outstanding, you can hear the pounding beat of the music increase  in intensity as the levels progress and the game becomes ever more frantic. Although the music is looped it isn't repetitive and I found, even after dying for the tenth time in a row, it still felt fresh and exciting helping to throw you back into the fight.  Gameplay 9 Hotline Miami is full of fast packed action, even best laid plans go astray in a moment forcing you to improvise, think on your feet and when all else fails rely on quick button pressing. As the levels progress the game becomes more challenging, but by this point your hooked and need to see the story through to the bitter end.   Story 9 Dark & suspenseful, the story is surprising deep and engaging (for what on the surface appears to be a fairly simple game). Sometimes the game will leave you wondering exactly what is happening to you, sometimes small details will change between levels (who's that person in my apartment? who is ringing my phone?...) but they all help to weave the story of the characters descent into a world of crime, murder and madness   Replayability 6 There isn't much to say here, the story is linear so it mostly depends on how much you enjoyed playing the first time round. There are lots of masks to collect which give you certain bonuses that might appeal to completionists.   Overall 9 A true gaming classic, retro 80's, ultra-violent, stylish, solid challenging game play with awesome music and a great story. lots of fun to play, highly recommended.

Ambient lighting and effects are excellent and the designers have succeeded in creating a diverse and atmospheric landscape. Character creation is good with a lot of customisation possible. All this, however, is completely and utterly eclipsed by what is possible with Mods. With Mods (readily available from the steam workshop) gamers are able to create breathtakingly stunning vistas, highly realistic characters, followers and NPC's. With over 24 thousand mods (at the time of this review) you can change the appearance of or add in pretty much anything you can imagine (the sky really is the limit). There is of course a performance trade-off when applying the ultra high definition textures and graphical mods so I recommend following one of the excellent guides available to find the right balance for you.   Audio 9 Music is grand and epic, very fitting to the feel of the game. Sound effects and voice acting are both excellent throughout and considering how many characters and quests there are in the world of skyrim this is quite a feat. Personal favourites for voice acting include the aptly named khajiit: M'Aiq the liar and the deranged murderous jester: Cicero.   Gameplay 9 Skyrim is a joy to play, its not perfect but its pretty close. Controls are intuitive, responsive and work well with either mouse/keyboard or controller. There are many choices to be made throughout the game with real consequences, factions will favour you or attack you depending on your actions and alignment with other factions. There are many different playstyles and strategies to Skyrim, finding what works best for you is all part of the fun. Skills and abilities progress as you use them so you aren't completely restricted to a class such as mage or ranger, want to use a little bit of magic but also kill with a bow - no problem. Skyrim is often compared to its predecessors (Oblivion and Morrowind) to highlight some of flaws in the game, and while its true to say some of the missions and areas feel overused (oh? another cave filled with draugr you say?) and there are other occasional glitches, considering the massive scope and scale of the game these seem fairly minor. Skryim in certain ways surpasses its predecessors and is at very least well deserving of its place in this legendary series.    Story 10 So much detail, so much depth, the lore and background to the Elder Scrolls series is second to none. In Skyrim there are huge libraries packed with books containing everything from children's stories to hidden tomes of magic to the history of the lands. Talking to the people you meet tells of their individual struggles and also adds to the overarching story of a land rife with conflict and caught in far reaching changes of which you find your character the center. Skyrim is rich with background and story, as you explore and interact with the characters around you its very easy to feel part of the world. Quests are (with a few minor exceptions) interesting, challenging and varied with each of them building your understanding of the world and your place in it.   Replayability 10 You only need to look at the number of hours people put into this game to realise how much Skyrim has to offer. Personally I had already completed this game many times before I got it on steam and was still able to get many more hours of enjoyment than the average rpg, I'm sure it wont be the last time I play Skyrim either. Modding here also helps immensely with the community creating a huge collection of different locations, characters and quests.    Overall 9.5 An outstanding game, if you haven't tried it then your missing out on a truly amazing gaming experience. The DLC's available (Dragonborn and Dawnguard) are worthwhile playing and some mods will require them (so pick up the GOTY if you can). More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

Audio 7 Pleasant background music throughout the game, there is a slightly oriental / mystical feel to the music which fits very well with the game. Sound effects are good.   Gameplay 8 Chaos Reborn is (at the time of this review) Early Access and as such some features / modes are not yet available, but I was able to try the single player (where you play against up to 3 AI opponents) and multiplayer battles. The learning curve upon starting the game doesn't seem as steep as I expected and players used to this genre of game will most likely feel right at home. You are prompted to start with offline single player battles to learn the game and I would recommend this. For your first battle you are given popups which prompt and help you learn different aspects of the game. At the start of each battle your character is given randomly a set of spells (some of which you have access to and others which are held in reserve) and a staff which favours a certain type of spell and contains a special powerful mega-spell which requires a number of mana gems to use. The players/AI then take turns to move their characters/summoned creatures around the battle arena, attack and cast a spell. You can also throw away spells which earn you mana gems and another random spell card from your remaining stack (be careful you can run out!). Each spell has a chance to work, these chances depend on how powerful the spell is and also on the balance of Chaos / Law spells that have already been cast. More Law spells being cast successfully make it easier for other wizards to cast Law spells, I found this very powerful and a really interesting feature. You can also increase the chances of a spell working with mana gems, but you need to be careful which spells to apply gems to and which ones to just gamble with. There is a good range of spells and the balance of power seems good overall, but the random nature of the spell draw coupled with the possible failure of spells can force your strategy. Summoned creatures have a set of stats (how good they are at attacking / defending / etc) and a large range of abilities to explore. You also have the ability to summon an illusionary version of your creature which removes the failure chance but leaves it susceptible to a spell called Disbelieve which will cause your creature to disappear (this can give a great advantage if you are able to bluff your opponents).To win you need to kill the other players or have the most killpoints (earned by killing opponents summoned creatures) when the turn timer runs out. The AI is good but of course the real challenge is battling against other players in multiplayer mode. The old adage ""easy to learn and difficult to master"" feels very appropriate for this game, but even when losing its a lot of fun to play.   Replayability 8 Chaos reborn has great replayability, the random nature of the spell draw, Law/Chaos Balance, placement within the battle arena and other conditions means you have a huge range of possible scenarios that you will need to deal with. There is no one winning strategy its a combination of dynamic strategy - adapting to and making the best to your current position, knowledge of your spells/creature abilities, skill and a bit of luck.    Overall 8 Chaos Reborn as it stands is a great game, fun in single player mode, challenging in mulitplayer and with some fantastic features being introduced that i'm really looking forward to (like the coop RPG mode). *** This review was made with a review key ***More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

I have to say the graphical style works well, you really get the feeling of a retro arcade game mixed with the colorful world of Adventure Time. Characters and screens are well done and animations are simple but good.  Audio 6 Simple audio and effects, again the retro feel is very evident. Some nice voice acting by the cast of the show, but they feel a little overused.  Gameplay 4 You play through 100 randomly generated dungeons fighting the occasional boss along the way, all the time collecting keys which are used to unlock doors/chests and treasures which can be used to buy training or equipment. The problem is that the levels are very simplistic/repetitive and the game quickly becomes tedious.   Story 3 There isn't really a story, the characters from Adventure Time are all there and there are a few nice moments but overall the clue is in the title - there is no reason to be exploring the dungeons beyond ""just because"".   Replayability 4 Being randomly generated should give the game a decent amount of replayability but because so many of the levels feel so similar it doesn't seem to count for much. There is a form of character advancement in that you can upgrade your stats and skills and you can buy items from the ""choose goose"", but considering the gameplay why would you want to keep playing it?    Multiplayer 4 The Multiplayer is LOCAL only (dont expect to be playing with your steam friends), and is decidedly average. It is somewhat reminiscent of gauntlet in that it usually descends quickly into who can collect the most treasure/food before everyone else, except that in this game certain characters have a clear advantage over others in terms of speed / flying over obstacles (A good way to fall out with friends).    Overall 4.5 While this game may appeal to young players and some fans of the show, I find it very hard to recommend it. Once the novelty has worn off there is very little reason to play this game.

Game Characters are also simple shapes with different colours but are easily identifiable. Background colours and effects have a different pallet for each level. The overall effect is minimalist, stylish and elegant.    Audio 10 Relaxing ambient background music throughout the game and excellent story narration by Danny Wallace (He won a BAFTA for his performance). There really is nothing to fault here.   Gameplay 9 Thomas was alone has simple and intuitive controls that respond well, giving good control of your characters. Levels start simply and get progressively more difficult at a fairly steady rate. I don't ever recall feeling overwhelmed at any point and play remained very enjoyable throughout the game. As you progress the game does a good job of introducing you to new concepts that you need to complete the levels like controlling various elements (doors, gravity, etc) through various pressure and trigger switches. Also as you progress you meet and gain control of other characters (besides Thomas) each of which have their own unique properties and abilities. You will often find that you will need to employ skill & logic as well as a bit of trial and error to successful navigate levels but fortunately the game does not punish you for failing, so play always seems fun.   Story 9 I really didn't expect any kind of story from a puzzle platform game, especially not one where the characters are just little shapes, but despite this what I got was a brilliant one. A delightful little story that builds with each level and makes you really care about what happens to your little shapes. Each one has their own unique characters, fears, desires and personalities. Their struggles to survive and escape the unfair system that imprisons them and which is constantly changing the rules in its efforts to defeat them.   Replayability 6 By the end of the game you will have mastered some pretty advanced skills and will remember many of the puzzles solutions, this makes some of the earlier levels feel very easy. The game is of a fairly good length but because its so enjoyable you will no doubt be left wanting more. There are various steam achievements (small black hollow rectangles) scattered throughout various levels and going back to find these will add to the playtime. Levels are re-playable after you have completed them making it a good game for quick casual play.   Overall 8.5 A little gem of an indie game, charming and enjoyable, it leaves you wanting more - would highly recommend.  More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

At points, however, it feels like it would be nice to have a little bit more variety to the areas, some of them feel quite samey. Character creation and portraits are ok but you can't go into the level of detail of some other RGPs.  Audio 7 Music and sound effects are good, there is however quite a bit of reading to do in this game, do not expect voice acting for all of the story / dialogue.  Gameplay 8 I really enjoyed playing this game, its a nice mixture of adventure / mystery and rpg with turn based strategic combat (think xcom). You control a small team of characters (you collect them as the story progresses) who follow you as you play through the story completing various missions and solving mysteries. There are some good puzzles to solve as the story develops and you can choose to upgrade various skills as your character advances in levels. A really nice feature is the ""hacking"" that the decker class can perform, this takes a form similar to combat in the game but its you and your constructs against the computer systems defences.    Story 8 Shadowrun Returns is set in cyberpunk-esque world where magic meets machine. You can play different stories in the form of campaigns, the official ones are complemented by community created ones via the steam workshop. The campaigns are extremely well done and have a very noir feel to them. There's a lot of background and detail to the world (and a lot of reading to be done) and the story had enough intrigue and action to keep me interested right to the end. The nature of the game (your characters acting out the story) basically means that play feels quite linear and that sometimes the decisions you make don't really have lasting effects but this didn't effect my enjoyment too much.    Replayability 5 As much of the main campaign is story based, once you have completed the game there isn't that much to draw you back in. Having said that there is an excellent DLC (dragonfall) and there are community created campaigns and an editor which should add quite a few hours of playability   Overall 8 Excellent game for anyone who loves this style of gameplay or the setting. The community content really adds a whole new aspect and lease of life to the game, just be prepared to do a lots of reading.  More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

Audio 9 Excellent music (I mean come on! its monkey Island I don't think I will ever get that tune out of my head) and really well done voice acting for all the characters. Gameplay 10 Ok, first I admit I am completely biased here: I love Monkey Island. Back from the days when I first got it to run on my 268 (I know showing my age) this game was something special. Monkey Island is one of the classic games from the golden age of point and click adventure games where LucasArts and Sierra ruled supreme with games like Day of the Tentacle, Sam & Max and the Kings Quest series. The controls have been reworked, making them more user friendly for a modern audience, but are still faithful to the original and don't detract from the game in anyway. Even if you weren't old enough to appreciate these games the first time round they are masterpieces and I feel stand the test of time.   Story 10 The game is pretty much all about the story (a truly amazing story), and while you are free to do some exploring around the islands and some trial and error with the puzzles, the story is essentially linear (so don't expect an open world game). The dialogue is full of dry humour and the situations (and solutions to puzzles) fantastical, absurd and brilliant. While the story has many aspects that will appeal to younger players (slapstick humor), much of the humour will appeal to adults. The puzzles are challenging but not to the point of frustration and are worked into the story well.   Replayability 7 If you have played the game its likely to be memorable enough that you will know the solutions to the puzzles, but its still good fun, and was for me very nostalgic.

UI is nice, detailed and easy to use  Audio 6 Music gets a little repetitive - maybe a little more variety needed, sound effects are good but nothing special. Gameplay 8 Age of Wonders III is a turn based, 4X strategy game based in a fantasy setting. The tactical combat view (when your army's battle) is excellent, you really feel like you are head to head with the AI (which seems to do a good job most of the time) in a battle of wits. Casting a well timed spell or outmanoeuvring your enemy can sometimes turn the tide of a battle, unfortunately usually the outcome of a battle is a forgone conclusion due to the relative strength of the units involved, but even when this is the case its still fun to crush your enemy and minimise your losses. The strength of the Units in your army really plays such a large part of the battles that you can actually choose to skip the tactical battle entirely and have the computer automatically calculate the results. Some of the units have somewhat of a balance issue with the higher level units often being able to take down whole armies by themselves with little damage or risk. This inevitably results in a race to upgrade your city buildings to create these higher level creatures. AI at the strategic level is a little predictable but there is still fun to be had placing your cities and grabbing as many resources as possible to fund your economy. One thing I noticed at the strategic level is there doesn't seem to be any downside to city spamming (covering the map in loads of your cities) as you gain resources (mana, gold, research) for each city. Ruins, shrines and artefacts are scattered throughout the maps and these will often require you to fight a monster to claim the reward for your Hero. Hero's are your army leaders you get a main one and then can hire more for gold. Hero's have a selection of spells they can use to aid you in battle, summon monsters or benefit your cities. Items you collect / make can be given to your hero's to increase their stats and they also get skills as they earn xp through battles.   Story 7 The game contains a number of well written scenario's which are fairly fun to play through. Overall I think I preferred playing the random maps though.   Replayability 7 If you enjoy the game you will probably want to play it again, random maps and steam workshop adds more community made content.   Overall 8 A fan of this genre will probably get a lot of enjoyment out of this game. While not as complex or detailed as others of the same type what it does it does well. Hotseat mode (a mode I loved from Civilisation) is a great addition to this game and playing with friends is a lot of fun. More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

858,76561198035346694,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198035346694/recommended/,United Kingdom,1,Recommended,177,12,"SID MEIER'S CIVILISATION V - Just one more turn?  || 9 || Score Comment   Graphics 8 Visuals are simple but pleasing, good textures on the landscape tiles, nicely detailed units with lots of variety, good animations and an intuitive unobtrusive UI.  Zooming in and out on units, cities and terrain allows you see all the little  details while also giving you the ability to see the ""big picture"" strategic view. Graphics are vastly improved from previous games in the series. If I had one wish I guess it would be to have your cities and their buildings represented better visually. Cities grow and spread with population and advance with technology/era and have several different styles depending on the nation you select, and the building of wonders will add the wonder to the area surrounding your city but it would be great to have further customisation of your cities so you could really make them your own. The Civilopedia (like an in game wiki) is a little difficult to navigate and while informative could use some work.  Audio 8 Game Music is relaxing and fitting, from the dawn of civilisation, the age of exploration or the grand age of empire building it just seems to work well and I very rarely feel the need to turn down the music volume (as I do with other games). The ambient sound is excellent, move your screen to a coastal area and you will hear the wash of the sea, select your boats and you will here the crack of oars or ring of their bell. The little touches and details like these really make the game a joy to play.  Gameplay 9 Civilisation is a turn based 4X (eXplore, eXpand, eXploit, eXterminate) game, a game of grand strategy & micromanagement, a game where the objective is to grown your civilisation and eventually conquer all through Technology, Culture, Diplomacy and Military might. This is by no means a simple game, it takes time to truly learn and fully appreciate but once you get into a game your hooked. Civilisation is by far the most addictive game (maybe with the exception of certain MMORGP's) out there. The ""just one more turn"" is a running joke because you will often find yourself planning on playing just one more turn to build something or win a battle and then you will look to the clock and find several hours have past. The start of the game is exciting, turns move quickly and you see your planning quickly realised, mid game you must continue your expansion and put in place what you will need to win. The only place where I feel this game falls down is late in the game, by this point sometimes there will be a clear winner, technology advancement will slow and your empire will often be so massive and units so numerous that just taking your turn can take quite a lot of time. Overall though gameplay is outstanding. The AI can be a little quirky at times but for the most part is challenging and tactically sound. Relationships between civilisations are all based on their predisposition and events which occur throughout the game and can therefore be somewhat predictable.   Story 8 The Story of history rewritten, the story of civilisation, so many details make up this game and so much background history on every aspect (via the civilopedia). The DLC add's on (amongst other things) quests which add to the story but in truth these add little to the game. The narrative is really what you make it, the interaction between the leaders of the other civilisations, all struggling for power, the alliances and conflicts mean there is very rarely a time of true peace or a dull moment.    Replayability 10 Fully customisable random maps, different scenarios, different civilisations and leaders. Make your own maps and scenarios, full integrated into steam workshop with hundreds of brilliant mods. It all adds up to a different experience each time and near infinite replayability.    Multiplayer 6 This is not an easy game to play multiplayer, the nature of the game means that you will all need a large amount of time to play a game through to completion, which may be problematic (especially with friends in different timezones or for people with connection issues). The most enjoyable aspect of multiplayer I found was the hotseat mode. In this mode you play locally and multiple players take the game in turns (like a boardgame), once again the time required to get near the end means you could be in for a very long (but very enjoyable) game.   Overall 9 While some purists will prefer the earlier Civ games in the series, I feel that Civ 5 (and especially with the main DLCs) is a worthy successor. It has the right level of difficulty and depth, much improved visuals and solid gameplay which will make you wonder where the hours went.  More reviews by Fancy FishAgree / Disagree?

Highly recommending it to my Targaryen group. It has many dynamic choices and outcomes, consequences and rewards, special benefits for each of the many rulers, all in the universe and style of Game of Thrones. I am excited to keep discovering more things, and it is definitely the best of the Reigns series I have played so far, made all the more enjoyable and special feeling due to my love of the Song of Ice and Fire series. Well done to Devolver Digital and all its developers and fellow big fans of GoT and its style. It is my hope more of my friends and fellows on Steam will discover this game and give it a fair shake. Onwards for this beautiful rendition, while it is simple and not like the big 3-d intense immersive style game with many visual effects and top notch graphics, it has some great backgrounds and portraits and its own unique style for the characters and the many locations set within the world of GoT. Congratulations on its awesome success, and like I said I hope more friends and fellow players and GoT lovers will discover this great time. Definitely the perfect game to play for twenty minutes or so here and there.

This is very important to note when looking at these reviews. People are pissed off because they payed $80+ during the kickstarter, and only got what they were promised much, much later. With that being said, this is actually a decent game. It has gone on sale for $10 or less, and at these prices it is definetly worth picking up. Although it took a long time to get there, it is currently a decent RTS, and is a bloody lot of fun to play as well. The premise of the game is simple. Annihilate. Having such a simple goals keeps the gameplay quite elementary, but allows it to focus on different mechanics. You are constantly at war with whatever other player/AI found themselves in your vicinity, and you will not rest until their planet lies in shambles. And you can literally do that! By nuking them into oblivion, crashing a moon into them or just blowing them up death-star style, planets can be severly damaged or even permanently wiped off of the map! Note: Your friends will get pissed at you if you use an annihilaser on them. Use with caution. The gameplay is also simple. There are 5 kinds of units: air, bots, vehicles, naval and orbital. These pretty much do what they say on the tin, and certain things are best used in specific situations (although bots and vehicles are pretty much interchangable). By creating an army (the biggest usually wins), you constantly attack your opponents base, destroying their resources or factories and giving you an adavantage. The game is won as soon as you kill their commander, while they are trying to do the same to you. If you start out on the same planet (and there are other planets in the system), you can transport or teleport your commander to those planets, only to start a new base and keep him safer. Establish orbital control to stop any hostile orbital fabrication bots from building teleporters and unleashing their entire army upon you. Its a lot of fun, and really easy to get into (*cough* Europa Universalis IV *cough*).Overall, you should definetly get the game if it is on sale. If not, probably best to buy only if you enjoy the RTS genre. It is a lot of fun to play with friends as well as alone, although there are some bugs here and there which are still being patched. I have not found anything gamebreaking so far though, so I think it should be okay. Anyway, it is a good game, and although it did not deliver well during early access (and after launch as well), it is worth picking up now.

It tells a deep, rich story through the use of signs, which also give you slight hints at the puzzles you are trying to solve. In the beginning of the game, it is more or less ""Wow, look at our crazy physics"", but later it becomes a true puzzle game. You'll find yourself on other sides of the map by just going through a door, you'll find new ways to solve puzzles by using new tools, you'll find paths that were always there, but you never realised them. It is quite short, but it is a must-play.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/219890,"20 June, 2015",13.2,4.9

This is already one of the best games out there, even with it being in early access, and it is bound to get even better. This game allows you to carefully plan a mission, build a rocket and then launch that rocket only to have it spectacularly blow up during a staging procedure. KSP has the potential of being an incredibly in-depth game, while also being a hilarious, mess-em-up explosion bonanza. It is so versatile, and it offers many, many mods to keep you coming back over and over again. Also, the developers have their own platform for modding, and intend to keep away from the paid-mod pile of asshattery. This game is worth 3x its current price. Get it.

Already got the platinium on the PS4 Pro version (25h for the story/50h if you want the 100%, DLC is on another map and takes around 15h.)Horizon Zero Dawn is a classic 3rd person view open world with a great story (including the DLC too), on the graphics side it's one of the most beautiful games of the PS4 (beaten by TLOU2 and RDR2).In my opinion Horizon Zero Dawn is a mixture between Tomb Raider (3rd person view, gameplay mechanics, craft), FarCry Primal (atmosphere), The Witcher 3 (3rd person view, atmosphere, RPG mechanics), and some Assassins Creed (3rd person view, climbing).The story takes place in the 31st century and follows Aloy. The world is dominated by robotics creatures : the ""machines"", humans on the other sides try to survive in different small groups.Aloy is a hunter trying to discover what happen to mankind, especially why the machines are becoming more aggressive over the years and on the other side why humans have such limited access to technology.Gameplay is where this game is really good, the battles against the machines are a lot of fun and got a lot of possibilities (especially the big one like the Thunderjaw or Stormbird), combats with humans are on the other side really poor.The games has no vehicle except that Aloy can ride some machines like a horse (yay).The game has a lot of collectibles, but there are not required to progress in the story.OST and sounds are also great.The game consumes a lot GPU power, Ryzen 3700X + 32Gb RAM + GTX1080 here and I got like 45fps average with the high settings on a 21/9 screen at 3440*1440.For the moment it also got a lot of stuttering, and it crash randomly (I bet a patch we'll be released soon).You can expect to gain some FPS if you tweak some useless options (wait for a full guide like RDR2 got), or to the devs to increase the performance.https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2190247414At 50‚Ç¨ if you are looking for this game since it was released on the PS4 or if you want a great story/gameplay/graphics then it's worth it. If not, then wait for a discount.Overall this game is my TOP5 PS4 exclusive games, among God Of War, TLOU2, Ghost of Tsushima, and Days Gone, maybe one day we'll get these on Steam.TL, DR:---{Graphics}---‚òê You forget what reality is‚òë Beautiful‚òê Good‚òê Decent‚òê Bad‚òê Don‚Äòt look too long at it‚òê MS-DOS---{Gameplay}---‚òë Very good‚òê Good‚òê It‚Äòs just gameplay‚òê Mehh‚òê Watch paint dry instead‚òê Just don't---{Audio}---‚òê Eargasm‚òë Very good‚òê Good‚òê Not too bad‚òê Bad‚òê I'm now deaf---{Audience}---‚òê Kids‚òê Teens‚òê Adults‚òë All (no blood, no executions in the game)---{PC Requirements}---‚òê Check if you can run paint‚òê Potato‚òê Decent‚òê Fast‚òë Rich boi (If you except to play at 1440p, hope you got at least a 2070/5700)‚òê Ask NASA if they have a spare computer---{Difficulity}---‚òê Just press 'W'‚òê Easy‚òë Significant brain usage‚òê Easy to learn / Hard to master‚òê Difficult‚òê Dark Souls---{Grind}---‚òê Nothing to grind‚òê Only if u care about leaderboards/ranks‚òê Isnt necessary to progress‚òë Average grind level‚òê Too much grind‚òê You‚Äòll need a second live for grinding---{Story}---‚òê No Story‚òê Some lore‚òê Average‚òê Good‚òë Lovely‚òê It‚Äòll replace your life---{Game Time}---‚òê Long enough for a cup of coffee‚òê Short‚òë Average‚òê Long‚òê To infinity and beyond---{Price}---‚òê It‚Äôs free!‚òë Worth the price‚òê If u have some spare money left‚òê Not recommended‚òê You could also just burn your money---{Bugs}--- (will be edited when patched)‚òê Never heard of‚òê Minor bugs‚òë Can get annoying‚òê ARK: Survival Evolved‚òê The game itself is a big terrarium for bugs								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/1151640,"27 November, 2020",46.7,1.3

J'ai eu le jeu gratuitement avec l'achat d'un CPU Intel, mais j'avais d√©j√† jou√© √† Just Cause 1 et 2 pour info.La version PCCommencement par le plus utile (et aussi le plus path√©tique) : l'optimisation du titre est absolument ATROCE.D√©j√† si votre PC n'a pas plus de 8go de RAM n'achetez pas ce jeu si vous visez l'ultra. (Les d√©veloppeurs l'ont confirm√© le jeu d√©passe la conso des 8go annonc√©s sur la fiche de steam, le seul moyen d'arriver √† faire fonctionner correctement le bousin est d'avoir 16go sinon bonjour le stuterring √† gogo).Passer ce d√©tail le jeu est tr√®s gourmand pour un rendu loin d'√™tre photor√©aliste mais plut√¥t joli dans l'ensemble avec des paysages tr√®s sympas pour les fans de screenshots.En ultra/1080p avec une config √† base de 4790K + 290X + 16go de RAM : j'obtiens en moyenne 80-90FPS avec des chutes √† 50 quand il pleut ou qu'il y a beaucoup d'explosions. L'utilisation du i7 est de l'ordre de 60%, la RAM est dans les 11go utilis√© (oui vous avez bien lu, sans aucun autre programme lanc√© :D).Autre info int√©ressante que j'ai remarqu√© r√©cemment : le jeu d√©teste √™tre lanc√© avec un pad de 360 branch√© au lancement.  En faisant √ß√† le jeu √† d'√©normes fuites de m√©moire et la conso de RAM monte jusqu'√† 100% puis crash (m√™me en ayant un SWAP de 40go sur SSD). Seul moyen de contourner le probl√®me : brancher sa manette une fois le jeu charg√© compl√®tement.Le soloL'histoire du jeu m√™me si elle est extr√™mement vu et revu est plut√¥t sympa : Rico (le gentil) vient en aide √† son peuple contre le m√©chant dictateur local DiRavello qui s√©vit sur l'ile. Tel un sauveur Rico va devoir lib√©rer l'ile au fur et √† mesure et vaincre le m√©chant dictateur. Outre les missions principales, Just Cause 3 propose une flop√©e d'avant-postes et de villes √† lib√©r√© ainsi que des missions al√©atoires et une grosse quantit√© de collectibles et d√©fi (courses terrestres/avions/bateau, wingsuit, d√©truire une base avec tel arme en faisant le meilleur score etc...).Le jeu propose un syst√®me de progression o√π l'on peut am√©liorer son √©quipement. Le probl√®me que j'ai trouv√© est que si vous voulez d√®s le d√©but du jeu r√©ussir √† faire les meilleurs scores pour d√©bloquer le plus de m√©canismes (le syst√®me de points du jeu) vous devez avoir les meilleures voitures/bateaux/armes qui sont accessibles uniquement √† la fin :/Du coup j'ai fini l'histoire avant de m'attaquer aux d√©fis.Le jeu dispose d'un nombre cons√©quent de v√©hicules : voitures, motos, bateaux, h√©licopt√®res, avions... La physique des v√©hicules terrestres est tr√®s rigide et absolument immonde en hors-piste : hors de question d'arriver √† g√©rer les bosses d'une route de campagne en allant trop vite. Les h√©licos et les avions sont cependant tr√®s simple √† prendre en main tout comme la wingsuit de Rico.Dur√©e de vieJust Cause √©tant un open-world, la dur√©e de vie est typique de ce genre de jeu : l'histoire prend environ 10-12h √† √™tre fini auquel on ajoute environ 5h de collectibles √† r√©cup√©rer, 5h de plus pour r√©cup√©rer tous les v√©hicules (dont certains sont bien cach√©s et difficiles √† r√©cup√©rer) et 10-15h de d√©fis. Au final le jeu souffre du m√™me probl√®me que Mad Max (du m√™me studio) : un solo sympa mais trop de qu√™tes Fedex qui deviennent lassantes et r√©p√©titives.Point int√©ressant, le syst√®me de largage de v√©hicules qui rend possible le spawn √† des lieux qui √©taient r√©serv√©s √† des trainers auparavant : qui ne r√™ve pas de descendre du plus haut point de l'ile √† moto ?Bande sonJust Cause 3 √† une VF qui est trop caricatur√©e au niveau des personnages de mon point de vue. Vous risquez de bien rigoler en entendant certaines r√©pliques totalement WTF et l'accent de certains persos. Les musiques sont cependant tr√®s sympa et en phase avec l'environnement.On ne le r√©p√©tera jamais assez : si vous n'avez pas la config recommand√©e passer votre chemin sous peine de le regretter, personnellement avec une config plut√¥t muscl√©e je me suis bien amus√© sur Just Cause 3 c'est pourquoi je le note en positif.Points +- L'ile est immense- Tr√®s fun √† jouer- Un bon d√©fouloir, √ßa p√™te de partout !- De jolis paysages- Le syst√®me de spawn de v√©hicules/armes- Un choix important de v√©hicules et armes (petite pens√©e au RPG au bavarium :D)Points -- L'optimisation totalement honteuse pour un jeu en 2015-2016.- Conso de RAM √©norme- Rendu trop ""simple"" pour la consommation du jeu- Jeu trop r√©p√©tif √† terminer √† 100%- La mentalit√© du studio qui pr√©f√®re pr√©parer les DLC au lieu de fixer ce foutu jeuNOTE GLOBAL - 6.5/10 // Un jeu avec un potentiel √©norme gach√© par une optimisation digne d'un Assasin's Creed Unity et dont le studio se fout royalement.Histoire - 6/10Gameplay - 9/10Graphismes - 7/10Physique - 4/10Audio - 7/10I.A. - 5/10								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/225540,"4 August, 2016",49.6,38.6

Je me consid√®rerai comme un vieux de la vielle, qui maintient que Call Of Duty doit rester une s√©rie faisant appel √† des conflits militaires et non √† un esp√®ce de mix futuriste entre Titanfall, Crysis et Destiny.Le soloTout d'abord commen√ßons par le commencement, le solo qui sans √™tre exceptionnel √† le m√©rite d'exister. La grosse annonce d'Activision fut sans aucun doute la pr√©sence de l'acteur Kevin Spacey qui joue un des principaux protagonistes. L'ensemble est plut√¥t classique (cette fois-ci on saute l'habituel USA VS Russie pour se concentrer sur le monde VS une bo√Æte priv√©e). L'histoire est tr√®s lin√©aire, et contrairement aux autres Call Of Duty est TROP bourrine, dans la dizaine de missions propos√©es il n'y a pas une seule qui requiert de l'infiltration √† la mani√®re de Modern Warfare sur la mission se d√©roulant √† Pripiat.Le tr√®s gros probl√®me du solo est justement caus√© par cette impression. Plus on avance dans l'histoire, plus celle de Modern Warfare 2 se r√©p√®te; √† savoir le gentil alli√© qui se retrouve enfaite √™tre le pire salopard, coucou G√©n√©ral Shepard !Enfin je noterais que le solo est propos√© √† la mani√®re d'un film Hollywoodien, SAUF que la fin n'est pas du tout en corr√©lation et manque tellement de th√©√¢tralit√© qui est la recette majeure d'un Call Of Duty (oui vous savez les trucs improbables qui n'arrivent que dans Call Of Duty).Le multilParlons maintenant de l'aspect essentiel d'un Call Of Duty (depuis Modern Warfare) : le multijoueur (parce que oui, jusqu'√† COD 3 le solo √©tait la pi√®ce ma√Ætresse). Activision a vendu son jeu comme plus fun, plus nerveux avec son gameplay futuriste, sauf qu'au final c'est tout le contraire. Au d√©but on se sent un peu d√©boussol√©, et le titre demande un temps d'adaptation pour le maitriser.Les modes de jeux restent classiques (avec les traditionnelles TDM/Domination mais √©galement des nouveaux modes plut√¥t sympa comme liaison satellite/avantage), sauf que les maps ne se pr√™tent pas toute bien √† ces nouveaux modes. Le syst√®me de customisation est plut√¥t bien pens√©, et le jeu propose un ensemble plut√¥t cons√©quent d'armes et accessoires. Sauf qu'on aimerait bien moins de truc qui ruine l'exp√©rience de jeu comme les lance-grenades ou autres d√©tecteurs de vis√©e.Le probl√®meVous devez-vous dire je fais finalement l'apologie de ce Call Of Duty et pourtant je le note s√©v√®rement, et bien en r√©alit√© tout n'est pas rose. Tout d'abord ce jeu souffre d'un tr√®s vieux probl√®me : pas de serveurs d√©di√©s. Ce qui fait qu'on se retrouve p√©nalis√© par un syst√®me hybride de P2P qui par moments offre de magnifiques d√©calages entre ce qu'on prend dans la tronche et ce qu'on voit dans la killcam. Avec l'argent que g√©n√®re cette s√©rie on peut se demander pourquoi depuis le temps ce n'est toujours pas r√©gl√© et on pourra remercier au passage Activision de sa politique des prix et le fait de vendre des DLC remplis de skins tous plus useless les uns que les autres. D'ailleurs on en rajoutera une couche avec le zombie qui se retrouve payant comme par magie.Ensuite le moteur graphique est toujours aussi primitif. Eh oui, les saccades, freezes et stuttering sont de la partie. De plus le jeu supporte tr√®s mal le multi-GPU (SLI ou CrossFire), ce qui a pour effet de rallonger les temps de chargements des maps et provoque de nombreux micros-lags extr√™mement chiants. L'autre incoh√©rence vient du fait d'avoir brid√© le multijoueur √† 91FPS, ce qui fait que les possesseurs d'√©cran 120/144hz (ou CRT si vous √™tes nostalgique^^) peuvent aller se coucher. Pourtant le jeu a √©t√© vendu comme un Battlefield-killer (au niveau graphique) et pourtant m√™me en Ultra le jeu reste tr√®s moyen avec un aliasing tr√®s prononc√©. Je ne parle pas non plus de l'optimisation du moteur physique qui arrive √† pousser un i5 4670K@4.4Ghz √† 100% de charges pendant les chargements.Certains se demandent aussi pourquoi des mecs gueulent √† cause d'aimbot ? Simple : prendre une manette et activer la vis√©e automatique qui fait tout le travail pour vous.La communaut√© en jeu est d√©plorable, le jeu se voulait fun et nerveux et bien c'est tout le contraire. Les √©quipiers ne connaissent g√©n√©ralement pas le mot objectif mais plut√¥t celui de camping (les tentes c'est chez Decathlon plut√¥t). Les spawns sont √©galement tr√®s foireux, combien de fois me suis-je retrouv√© √† spawner √† 2 m√®tres d'un type.Enfin je terminerais par l'√©quilibrage des armes du multijoueur qui est catastrophique, les armes lasers (l'EM1 en t√™te) sont tellement puissants qu'ils rivalisent avec quasiment tout (du pistolet au fusil de pr√©cision) et ne parlons pas de l'ASM1 avec laquelle j'arrive √† d√©foncer des snipers √† plus de 100 m√®tres.Ah et j'oubliais : le jeu ne supporte pas le Eyefinity/Surround et peut-√™tre pas non plus le 21/9 nativement, donc si vous voulez jouer sur 3 √©crans ou plus (ce qui est mon cas) vous devez passer par un logiciel alternatif qui fait correctement la mise √† l'√©chelle (ceux qui sont int√©ress√©s : Widescreen Fixer) - un comble pour un jeu AAA comme celui-ci.LES PLUS- Un concept original.- Un gameplay plut√¥t sympa mais qui requiert un petit temps d'adaptation.- Le solo qui a le m√©rite d'exister.- Le multijoueur qui est assez fun √† jouer.LES MOINS- Le moteur graphique historique.- L'optimisation √† revoir totalement : lags, freezes et crashs et consommation de RAM √©norme pour les faibles qualit√©s du titre.- Le multi-GPU tr√®s mal g√©rer.- L'ATH qui bug et l'image compress√©e en Eyefinity/Surround.- L'histoire du solo trop t√©l√©phon√©, trop pr√©visible.- La limite de 91FPS en multi, on se demande pourquoi ?- Les connections, je te met 2 balles et le coup d'apr√®s tout le chargeur y passe sans aucun d√©g√¢ts.- Aucun √©quilibrage en multi, 3 ou 4 armes au-dessus de tout le reste.- La communaut√© : remplis de rageux, haineux...- Les spawns foireux qui pourrissent le gameplay.- La politique d'Activision qui se r√©sume √† : pognon, pigeon, pognon, pigeon...NOTE GLOBAL - 4/10 // Call Of Duty Advanced Warfare est un concept int√©ressant entach√© par sa technicit√© et sa communaut√© pr√©historiqueHistoire - 4/10Gameplay - 7/10Graphismes - 5.5/10Physique - 3/10Audio - 5/10I.A. - 3/10								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/209650,"13 March, 2015",10.6,10.6

As soon as i finished the game, i had the urge to write this review, the urge to share with the world how amazingly complex and mind-boggling this game is.Orwell in a way reminded me of  Papers, Please  (Which you can find my review of it  HERE ).In Orwell you will be The Big Brother. You will snoop into people's lives and find some and some less sensitive information about said people.Orwell Does not contain much gameplay, Yet it succeeds to be an amazing piece of art, Solely with it's story.Do i recommend Orwell? Absolutely.It's amazing. It's unique.  It's not for everyone. I won't recommend it though, for people who get bored easily, and look for gameplay and graphics rather than story. EDIT : So now that i managed to do all endings and basically turn the game inside out for the achievements, it's safe to say this game is a 10/10. Every single conflict you'll encounter will guarantee to have an impact on the way the story goes, making you really question which one to add to the database.There are numerous endings, each one has it's own consequences and effects on The Nation (Where the game takes place).As said earlier, get it only if you're a nut for a good, solid storyline.

Your choices matter and will change and define the story you experience. Purchase ""The Wolf Among Us"":http://store.steampowered.com/app/250320/‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïêWhen it comes to quality story gameplay, you can't go wrong with Telltale Games. and ""The Wolf Among Us"" is no surprise to be one of the best story driven games on the market.The game takes place in Fabletown, New York, after all the fairy tales' characters had escaped the woodlands to live a modern life, leaving everything behind. You play as Sheriff Wolf Bigby, who was in the past the Big Bad Wolf from the Little Red Riding Hood story. Throughout the story you'll investigate the story of the Murder of two Prostitues -  Holly the troll and Faith (A.K.A Donkeyskin). Atmosphere The game's atmosphere is amazing. there's always this noir feeling to it and you just want to keep playing for ""just 10 more minutes"".StoryThe game sucks you into it's amazing atmosphere and story. It'll question your moralities and decision making abillities. You will have the option to play as the vicious bad cop, or be kind (each is satisfying on its own). You will get emotional.Whether it's the brilliant voice acting, the absolutely AMAZING writing or the fantastic story, this game is not one you will forget after you're done playing it. Graphics Simple, yet sophisticated. Cartoon-ish, which fits the game perfectly since the game's about fairy tales and stories.Not many graphic options, but it doesn't really matter in this game, where the main focus is on the story telling abillity. Final Score - 10/10This game left an impact on me. the kind of impact that, once you finished the game, you know there isn't any game like that, and you wish you could play it for the first time again. i hope Telltale will give us a  2nd season of this marvelous game. Buy it now!  ",https://steamcommunity.com/app/250320,"26 April, 2016",14.7,9.5

But Mad Max is nothing like that. Mad Max is an absolute gorgeous game, let alone it's optimazation is great aswell, the combat is extremly fun and the driving's fun and action packed. So witout further ado, let's review this bad boy!Pros: Story is great, immersive and really lurs you in, as Max is on his journey to find his beloved car and to find some solace.The charachters are really in depth, and has their own stories and journeys.Cutscenes are well made The game's gorgeous, one of the best Wastelands i've seen in a videogame. This game is like a mashup between Fallout (Exploring locations and scavenging for supplies) and Sleeping Dogs (Same combat system, and there's an emphasis on car-to-car vehicular combat.) Lots of customisation available, starting from Max's armor and jacket, to his haircut and facial hair. there's also an incredible range customisations available for the Magnum Opus, max's signature car along the game. Great SFX and voice acting, really gives that atmospheric feeling to it. You won't run out of thing to do! there's  alot  of activities and side quests to do. Combat system is really simple and great. Well made upgrade system. you can shoot ROCKETS FROM YOUR CAR!Cons: What would seem like a big surprise for a game that is so focused about driving and cars, there's no handbrake!The ending is really anticlimatic and short, and it just sums the whole fantastic story really badly (in my opinion of course). glitches oftenly occure, although most of them are minor and not that big of a deal.So, the final rating i give for Mad Max is -  9/10 For me, Mad Max is one of the best, funnest games i've played and is on my Top 5 Games of 2015.Heavily recommended, especially when it goes on sale for  20$ .

The storyline has really nothing to do with the essence of Agent 47 or his personal traits. he suddenly grows emotions, like empathy which you would not expect from a cold hearted killer like 47. The game itself is linear and just feels like ""Alright, go from this point, kill some bad guys, go to this place aaaand cutscene"". In Conclusion Hitman: Absolution‚Ñ¢ is a good game. not a great game, but certainly not a bad one either. it's a fresh breath of air to the series, mainly because it's completely different than the previous games - which is both a blessing and a curse.

The game wants you to fail just to follow the path of the phoenix such as ""you give everything you have got, you die and you become even stronger after rebirth"". This rebirth can be activated manually (next recollection) or automatically when all of your daughters were killed (same recollection mechanic).The next recollection will reset everything you have achieved except remembrances bonuses (for example, +15% of health for all daughters), special currency for buying remembrances and 3 strongest of your alive daughters. Also, last 32 dead daughters will be saved in resurrect chamber to be revived for special in game coins.2. you will be forced to make hard choices such as sacrificing your daughters for the greater good;This is the main idea of the game: you have to sacrifice daughters to win a battle and this war. This sacrifice can be made by:- holding the enemies to let other daughters and/or bright soul escape- sacrificing daughter to heal another daughter (there are no other way to heal daughters in nightmare mode)By doing the sacrifice you are not just healing daughter but also give her part of her sister power called traits (for example +532 HP and +1% of evasion). So as mentioned in item #1 by each loss you become stronger.3. timeline and your position on the battlefield are the keys to victory;The timeline in this game is dynamic and each move/attack/ability might change the order of turns and possible outcome of the fight. Your daughters are always outnumbered (sometimes 4 or 5 times) and sometimes outgunned (enemies are stronger) on the battlefield. This are your main disadvantages. In order to defeat your enemies you should:- keep your daughters united and enemies separated to face it one by one or wave by wave (use terrain features and timeline management);- analyze each your move and keep an eye on enemy attack range;- remember that each hit your daughters take will move you closer to a hard choice of sacrifice.4. game will punish you for every mistake you made;As mentioned in previous items, each action has a consequence; each hit will move you closer to a needed sacrifice; each death of your daughters will lower your army number. So keep that in mind when you play this game of thrones scenario;5. there is autosave onlyAction has consequences and you cannot escape it by shutting down game and reloading last save. Every move you make, every action you do will be registered for the only one goal: to face the outcome of your choices.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/798490,"30 December, 2020",13.9,11.0

There are no memorable characters like Amy, Cassandra, Setsuka, Hong Yun-seong and some others. Customization options are not enough;There are literraly 10 options in each section. Moreover, some of those are locked and you have to buy it with ingame currency. As a fan of Soulcalibur games I can affirm that this is the worst Soulcalibur customization menu ever! Story of characters and canonical issues;Lets be honest this is an AAA game for 60$. For that price you expect something good, right? Well there is a problem with that. First of all, there are no cutscenes. All you can see is changing from time to time pictures with avatars of heroes. Voice acting for some characters is awful (I am speaking of eng localization). In addition to that, sometime characters are showing wrong expressions (like in Groh story then his friend Curtis is screaming but avatar is smiling Oo).But the most strange thing is that nightmare is now an evil version of Siegfried! WTF Namco?! He is supposed to be his father but no we are supposed to impress auditory of our game...Lets make something veeeeery strange, right Namco?Final rating and recommendation for/against buying game:Final rating: Game is beautiful and colourful but with those cons I can conclude that at this current build of the game I am very dissapointed.Recommendation for/against buying game: I cannot recommend this game to be bought (even If I wanted to).

WHAT?- Main review:- The technical side of the game:So, I played a little and can supplement my review. I can tell right away that I am impressed with the download speed online, it is much faster than in GTA5. And also, I was not thrown out ten times when trying to connect, did the rockstar do a tremendous job and fix their sh*tty servers?UPD. A few days later I found out that they hadn't fixed the servers. To go online I have to use vpn. THANKS.There are big problems with the sound, nothing is heard at all. And there is no way to fix it.UPD. The sound must be adjusted in the Windows mixer.You can go to the settings only after creating a character and viewing the intro. But I want to do it right away!- A little about the pc version:Since I came here from the console version of the game. I will also give my opinion about the PC version itself, and not just online.Finally i can play with unlocked frame rate.Vast selection of graphical options for fine tuning your desired experience.Increased draw distance.Overall improved textures.HDR support and up to 3840 x 2160 resolution support.Ultra wide and multi-monitor setup support.- Content:Grind, grind, grind.Monetizing Red Dead Online has become even more aggressive. For example, for completing a Battle Pass worth 40 gold bars, you can only get 30 bars - that is, you have to donate again to buy the next season pass.In modern service games like Apex Legends, Call of Duty, and Fortnite, players not only return all investments, but also increase them when fully completing the Premium Pass branch. For example, a Call of Duty subscription costs 1000 coins, and you can get 1400 coins for completing a season.In addition, starting today in Red Dead Online, the reward multiplier for completing Daily Challenges resets at 28 days, after which you have to start all over again. At the same time, prices for premium projects are gradually increasing.- Conclusion:I think this can be done. Rockstars are just trying to siphon all the money from their players without offering anything in return. 4 bucks game, of course, is worth it. For a couple of weeks here you can have fun with friends, and then abandon the game. After all, you did not give the full price, so it's not a pity.

(and I haven‚Äôt met this yet) and empathize, worry or support them in monologues (yes, Artyom‚Äôs voice has not yet been delivered, Gordon Freeman sends his regards).The developed and almost open world in some large locations is very impressive, accessible to the player to research, search for loot and improve equipment and weapons, random encounters and search for notes and tapes for understanding the plot as a whole, etc.It used to be fun to watch comparisons between STALKER and METRO.I always understood that the first is huge open locations, open lands and so on, and the second is linear corridors and tunnels and that it‚Äôs simply impossible to compare these games ...But with the release of Exodus, you realize that here is as spiritually Stalkera as possible. But not about that.+ I liked the customization of the weapon and its presentation itself. The body kit of trunks and the improvement of Artyom‚Äôs suit are elegantly presented and woven into the mechanics; almost all of them are clearly worth the time spent searching for them.+ Gorgeous traced locations. Very atmospheric. Winter on the Volga River, the dried Caspian Sea with rotting hulls of ships and shacks, rotting their age, autumn Taiga with beautiful forests and rivers and the Dead, abandoned winter city, which only drives you almost depresnyak, from its doom, ""grayness"" and hopelessness+ Excellently expanded bestiardia of monsters.+ Interaction with characters is simply incomparable. The game crashes pretty well into the brain and evokes emotions, I haven‚Äôt been so impressed with the history of people who often want to help ... and you do it over and over again.+ Graphics. Everything is on top for me. Weapons, landscapes, and room interiors are well designed: bunkers, abandoned huts, tunnels of abandoned metro, etc.+ I really liked how the navigation is presented in the form of a tablet with a map and current tasks.Compass on hand, Geiger counter, Artyom detection sensor in the dark, etc. All this is very well implemented and the main thing is not meaningless.+ Train Aurora. A wonderful and atmospheric hub for the player to take a break from long explorations of the world and dangerous zones. Get to know the characters better, get high from the interior of the equipped wagons, listen to music and talk on the radio waves of unfamiliar survivors among themselves, smoke a cigarette and have a little thump ...You can still write a lot about the pros of the game, I found a huge number of them, but I just recommend buying this wonderful product to every player.Despite the publisher‚Äôs idiotic policy, it wasn‚Äôt worth underestimating the ratings of the previous parts in this way - this is primarily stupid and stupid. They gave us a great series and maybe! already regretted the transfer of the game to EGS, but there was no turning back ...

I didn‚Äôt think that something like this would ever come out, where you once pay and download any wallpaper to your liking, but do not give your money every time for new wallpapers with a new theme. Optimization was also pleased when even at 60 frames and maximum smoothing the animation does not break and does not lag, this is definitely a big plus compared to other similar programs that offer you live wallpapers that, although it looks better than what the Steam community offers, but and requires quite a bit of RAM for stable operation, and they load the processor due to the fact that they do not know how to enter into sleep when starting applications.I advise you to buy.

Graphics, gameplay, variety - everything is on the level. Constant updates of content from developers. It has been 5 months since I first launched it. Since then, so much new in-game content has been added that already eyes widen. And they don‚Äôt even plan to stop,The game has thousands of ways ""how stupid to die,"" and she will throw you a challenge all the time. Over time, you will learn to keep fit and not die dumb deaths or starvation, and then additional opportunities will open up for you: extreme boss battles, dangerous caves and ruins, magic and an effective cooperative.I recommend to all-all-all.

You can also see and feel the things that other people have done.It should be reminded that in multiplayer a huge number of game modes, from the usual Sandbox, to the most popular - Trouble in Terrorist Town. There is also a bunch of functionality, you can make a car, art.Golden hands are capable of creating animations.

Mas n√£o se engane, a simplicidade acaba ai, esta mistureba de g√™neros feita pela  Duoyi, deu muito certo! Vou listar alguns fatores:‚úîÔ∏èA gama de armas dispon√≠veis √© sensacional, 44 at√© o momento, cada uma com caracter√≠sticas √∫nicas, e n√£o tem arma ruim ou boa, todas se encaixam de acordo com a build que esta sendo criada no personagem, modos de disparos diferentes, uma enxurrada de atributos aleat√≥rios, sendo que voc√™ pode roletar esses atributos e at√© refinar o dano base. Ahh, quase esquecendo, o visual delas √© lindo demais, com muitas anima√ß√µes e efeitos.‚úîÔ∏è Existem 4 personagens, com habilidade prim√°ria e secund√°ria, e atributos base diferentes. Ao decorrer das dungeons, upgrades de habilidade s√£o adquiridos atrav√©s de ba√∫s espalhados pelo mapa, esses upgrades s√£o distintos, cada habilidade possui v√°rios seguimentos. Rel√≠quias tamb√©m s√£o encrontradas, 128 no total, e alteram muito a maneira de se jogar, sem deixar a gameplay na mesmice.‚úîÔ∏èAs dungeons s√£o geradas de maneira procedural, com 3 n√≠veis de dificuldade. Cada n√≠vel com suas recompensas e elementos novos.‚ùóÔ∏è O √∫nico ponto negativo √© o sistema de reconex√£o, que numa eventual queda, n√£o permite que o jogador volte para a partida, espero que melhorem isso imediatamente.Todos esses elementos misturados entregam um leque infinito de op√ß√µes, √© incrivelmente divertido jogar estudando tantas possibilidades de build, armas, habilidades e maneiras de prosseguir na sua run. Al√©m disso √© uma excelente op√ß√£o para jogar com amigos, muito desafiador j√° que a quantidade de jogadores reformula o n√≠vel de dificuldade, sem perder a gra√ßa.Recomendo fortemente, 24$ chega a ser um valor simb√≥lico para um jogo de acesso antecipado que esta praticamente pronto, polido e com muito conte√∫do. A empresa acabou de anunciar uma nova atualiza√ß√£o com personagem novo, arma nova, uma cacetada de coisas, e totalmente de gra√ßa!

Cada ambiente, tanto interno como externo, possuem tra√ßos muito caracter√≠sticos. Existe um ""gloss√°rio"" interessante com a lore das armas, criaturas e locais.‚úîÔ∏è A ambienta√ß√£o √© muito acima da m√©dia para um jogo competitivo, Crytek fez um trabalho surreal neste aspecto, a imers√£o √© insana, melhor que muito AAA. Ao movimentar-se, cada part√≠cula do mapa emite efeitos sonoros responsivos e interagem com cada movimento. √â impressionante observar o personagem esgueirando em meio a vegeta√ß√£o, esbarrando em uma garrafa ou o rangir da madeira ao caminhar.  A sistem√°tica mesclando PVP/PVE tamb√©m √© um dos seus destaques. Mesmo entregando esses fatores com excel√™ncia, na minha opini√£o n√£o sustentam um jogo focado em PVP. Hunt: Showdown se tornou caro, com uma comunidade pequena, principalmente na Am√©rica do Sul.‚ùå A maior parte das partidas sofri com ping alto. O sistema de busca desloca quem joga da Am√©rica do Sul para a regi√£o secund√°ria. Ao selecionar apenas SA como regi√£o de busca, o resultado √© muita demora. Formar grupo com amigos pode ser mais r√°pido, por√©m com o grande risco de cair em partidas vazias. Falando nisso, n√£o tem como saber quando se esta sozinho. Voc√™ pode estar jogando da forma mais t√°tica poss√≠vel, numa partida apenas com NPC's. Talvez seja o tal ""hardcore"" que dizem.‚ùå  O desbalanceamento √© evidente, jogadores novatos/experientes nas mesmas partidas, e n√£o estou falando de free for all ou casual, √© Matchmaking mesmo. A falta de divis√£o de rank, talvez seja pela car√™ncia de jogadores. Como era de se esperar o novo sistema de pareamento de partidas por n√≠vel de habilidade da Att 16/04/21, apenas deixou ainda mais demorado encontrar partidas, e mesmo ativado eventualmente acaba n√£o funcionando.‚ùå Vejo um potencial gigantesco disperdi√ßado em rela√ß√£o a PVE/COOP, o mapa permite muitas possibilidades, poderiam investir em modos desafiadores, como defender hordas de monstros buscando abrigos em casas, capturar itens etc. Isso consequentemente fortaleceria a comunidade, conquistando novos jogadores.‚ùå Ainda que rode melhor que no beta, falta ajustes, como ao iniciar ou sair de uma partida, a tela de loading simplesmente congela todo seu computador por um longo tempo, e nem ALT+TAB salva. Falta sistema de notifica√ß√£o ao encontrar partidas, voc√™ √© obrigado a vegetar na tela de busca, ou corre o risco de perder o grupo.‚ùå O estopim para escrever esta an√°lise, foi o que aconteceu recentemente. Tive a infelicidade de ser expulso de partidas pelo anti-cheat tr√™s vezes seguidas! Foi somente nesse dia, mas em tempos de banimentos gratuitos, isso √© preocupante. O mais engra√ßado √© que o hack come solto. Infelizmente n√£o posso recomendar esse jogo, principalmente pra quem joga SA. Pode ser divertido jogar esporadicamente com amigos, mas a longo prazo, fica vis√≠vel que esses problemas v√£o atrapalhar sua jogatina. Um jogo inconsistente, desbalanceado e relativamente caro at√© o momento. Crytek foi ambiciosa em basicamente duplicar o pre√ßo ap√≥s o lan√ßamento, acredito que isso espantou grande parte de jogadores. Uma pena, esta engatinhando a 3 anos com um jogo que poderia facilmente estar em outro patamar. Espero que melhore e futuramente eu possa refazer essa an√°lise positivamente.

Perhaps confusing at first, but throughout history the messages will highlight important points. Finally, many possibilities for interpretation remain open and I believe that this strengthens the premise of the game, each player will have his own experience and theory. The soundtrack and ambient sounds are incredibly engaging. A very relaxing and beautiful experience.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/520720,"29 October, 2020",2.4,2.4

Like I said it's a little broken. Yes, this is playable on Steam Deck just fine on Proton 5.13-6 setting. Otherwise you will get a viewpoint error when launching the game.

Visually it looked pretty good for my tastes.As far as what I have played, I can say the state of the game is playable and can get casual enjoyment out of it. Yes, quite rough for what it is right now, however, the structure is there and believe this game has lot's of potential.Optimization on my main rig, I had no problems with 100% scaling. On my Steam Deck, I have also played this on does run it averagely well, but not butter smooth. I'll have another section for this later.For what the game gives you, several cars, plenty of upgrades. Both Performance and Body Work. Let's not forget Stance and Wraps as well. The game does have a good Eurobeat vibe. You have a Highway course, which unfortunately is one way and no exits. I hope this changes. You can race with other people, though, traffic is not sync with other racers. There's police as well, simply you just outrun them or get busted. This is a challenge at first because you're slow, of course.The game does become more enjoyable the more upgrades you put on. I for sure hope for more of a progression system.For what the game is and price, not too bad. Definitely improvements can be made. I'll be following this for sure for future updates.Steam Deck Verification.Going to assume very few playing this on the Steam Deck as of right now. I figured to give it a try. Performance-wise it's pretty average. At 80% scaling you can get a Solid 60fps experience for the most part. Though, some dips to 52 that are short-drops do happen here and there. Game is playable however. 100% Scaling you go down to 42FPS with the same problem with the 80% scaling. 40Hz lock, it does stay close to 40fps. At times it would do a micro-drop to 38fps.Controls work out of the Community Layout. I have used this game on the Xbox S controller of mine on the Desktop, I had no problems.Biggest problem I am running into however. No Cross-Sync on your progress. You restart from the beginning from a different device. This should be addressed. Personally not a huge deal for me, I'll play this more on my Desktop. However, it would be nice to play it in bed or on the couch for a casual session. So I'm not given an option here. Surely some can relate.Overall I'll rate the experience Playable. Verified once those minor issues are addressed.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/2073470,17 July,2.1,1.6

Though, you can still tell it's a Ubisoft game by how lazy and cookie-cutter the map placement is. However, the gameplay is quite fun and relaxing as you put Spotify or any app to play some tunes. This game is not a simulator, nor an arcade-sim. It's pure arcade with silly physics. Lot to explore, fair amount of content, decent amount of vehicle selections and unique choices of driving a plane and a boat. Though, the core aspect of the game shifted to focus on cars more as they were favored compared to the other two. Don't expect much of a story (Which racing games lack anyways) and good dialogue. It's really just cliche social media garbage that can be overlooked.You could compare Forza and The Crew 2. Forza is the obvious winner here. But The Crew 2 is fun and unique in it's own way. The Forza elitists will seethe and disagree when reading this. Get some friends, do races, explore, it's quite an enjoyable experiences.Would this game be worth it full price? Honestly I'd argue no. Yes, I do think the game is fun but the quality of it is really a night and day difference with Forza. There ARE some customization for vehicles, however, not at NFS level. I've personally gotten the Gold version for $30 and pretty satisfied with it. As this being a Ubisoft game, I have to say the support on this game is pretty good. New cars and content always added. The game is unfortunately Online Only based. It's heavily relied with Online services.TL;DR: Overall pretty decent Ubisoft title. Pure arcade, despite Forza being better in quality, this game can be fun in it's own ways especially with friends or just to vibe to with Spotify in the background.

Game actually doesn't force you to be a raider. You can literally off the raiders at any point (would recommend towards the end of the DLC) and free the slaves. Baffles me what these reviews are talking about. Some are justified, most are just exaggerated.Even with a Minutemen playthrough, it was not conflicted when I chose to free the slaves. Yes, you can work with the raiders to free the park, however, as I already mentioned, you can off all of them at the end when they want to take over the commonwealth. Don't see the problem here. You're given a choice of what you want to do.I would mostly recommend this DLC for the exploration, weapons, and just a new location to explore just like Far Harbor. Don't expect much as of a good story.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/490650,17 March,0.0,0.0

For the first two hours, I'm quite satisfied. Though, I do wish Dunovo was not included. Fortunately, I have not run into any problems yet. 1440p on High Settings with my 5700XT. The only change I made was disabling motion-blur.Things I liked:I do enjoy the location that was picked, especially from the start of the game. A nice introduction and references about previous events, backstories of how the infection happened. I'm not expecting much of a story, but so far I think it's been alright. Some of the character details are just amazing.Combat is a subjective topic. I'm pretty neutral with the combat. It certainly takes time to get used to. I think the Human x Human combat is much more engaging compared to the first Dying Light.The parkour aspect is also a subjective topic. Just as I mentioned about the combat, it does take time to get used to. It honestly was a bit frustrating at first in some segments. I'm pretty neutral about the change. This is subject to change in the future as I unlock more perks.Things I don't like:As for as I played, Night-time isn't as dark as the first Dying Light. Do note I'm on my first night, I'm not sure if it's just the reflection of the Moon itself, I was disappointed by how light it is when exploring at the night.Dunovo. Why did you add this?No weapon repair? At least what I'm aware of, there is no weapon repair system.UI I'm personally not a fan of. I enjoyed what Dying Light 1 had. I feel like if you kept the same formula, it would be perfectly fine.Why can't you sprint by default? Countless times you naturally want to press Shift (or whatever control input) to run faster. I'm not much of a fan of having yourself run by default.My Experience Overall:It's aight. I think it's not the greatest nor the worst game, it's decent. The first Dying Light was jank in it's own ways too. But some of the things were done better I admit. I have not run into anything bug-related, I'll be honest. But I know they're out there. Though I'm still early in the game, I'm sure I'll run into something at one point. Performance is apparently bad, guess I'm one of the lucky ones that didn't have the problem. It's a mixed bag, there are things I wish they kept from Dying Light 1 and moved over for the second game. Meanwhile, there are some changes I like. But recommending this at $60? I didn't have many expectations and enjoyed what I played so far. I cam agree to wait for a sale if you're patient enough.If you're expecting much of a Dying Light 1 feel and don't like change, you're going to be disappointed.

Das n√§chste Update (fire ant) soll laut Support in den ""n√§chsten"" Monaten (Datum?) sein. Auch ein release Datum wird nicht angegeben. Im Grunde genommen kann das Spiel und dessen Entwicklung als tot angesehen werden. Spieleinhalt. Minikampagne mit 3 LevelnEinige kniffelige SzenarienFree Play Modus mit 4 festen Maps. Wird aber schnell langweilig.Die angesagten knapp 20‚Ç¨ muss jeder selbst entscheiden ob er sie daf√ºr ausgeben m√∂chte. Ich w√ºrde es nicht wieder machen.Anfagen der Community werden mit den gleichen steriotypen Antworten bedacht: Wir haben zu wenig Ressourcen, ein gutes Spiel braucht nun mal lange (5+ Jahre?), nach dem n√§chsten Update denken wir das an (Planung, Datum?), nach dem release (Datum?) werden wir dar√ºber nachdenken.

This is a small package, but is bursting with clever design decisions and pure unadulterated addictive action. APE OUT is first-and-foremost an arcade score chaser, with a short yet interesting campaign that intends to showcase a series of different ideas. Each idea forces you to adapt and even rethink how to go about things. And every idea in here really works. The artwork is nothing short of brilliant, and is used in many creative ways. For example, the second Disc skyscraper blew my mind. I just loved that. From the color palettes to simple-yet-clear textures to that wicked camera angle - it all creates an exhilarating atmosphere. Moving on. This title makes one of most creative uses of music that I've witnessed in ages. Maybe ever. Yes, it's nuanced and small - but also genius. I was sold with just the jazz level, and then it changed! That marching band 3rd Disc is powerful stuff.  But then we have some more nuance. I was watching the developer live stream, and they made some interesting comments. They mentioned that the rooms don't actually make sense because that's probably how it would feel through the eyes and mind of a confused and rampaging ape. Same idea for how everyone would appear to be an enemy. Now this is also a convenient narrative to excuse proc gen - but I don't care because it's also wildly interesting. And the proof is in the pudding - if there is one thing that is undeniable about this title - you truly do feel like a confused and rampaging ape. You only need the edge of your seat for this one.Pros:+ This is a brilliantly designed game.+ The way the music is implemented is not only as fresh as it gets, but it both sounds outstanding and pairs perfectly with the gameplay.+ This is very addicting.+ Leaderboard support is awesome.+ I find there is a good bit of strategy here; definitely less twitchy than some of it's comparisons.Cons:- We could use some QoL options like the ability to adjust volume while playing.- When I use windowed mode, or really change any resolution settings it usually crashes and logs me out of Steam. I've learned to just not touch things.- The main 'game' is quite short. While what is present is fantastic, maybe they could have added in a bit more. And then again, maybe it's good that it doesn't overstay it's welcome.This is the first great game I've played in 2019. Worth full price.

The same problems and design issues I took with my first experience still persist today. Frankly, as a casual player of Beacon, I couldn't tell you what has actually changed over the last year from just my in-game experiences. The whole thing feels like a case of style-over-substance. Obviously the asking price matters here.Beacon wants to be the next big rogue-ish shooter, but I can't get past some fundamental flaws. First off, a word of warning: controller users are second-rate citizens here. I know the store page claims 'full controller support', but it is very much just emulating the mouse. Some games can get away with this, but not here.  Not with something requiring this much precision. Even the developer recognized and acknowledged it's hard to beat a keyboard and mouse here (in one of my threads on the forum). I only complain about this because it didn't have to be this way. This could have been easily designed from the ground up as a controller-friendly game.The art and aesthetic is brilliantly crafted, but I'm sorry to report that the game itself is just not that much fun. This has all been done before in better ways. The camera angle is decidedly awkward considering you can and will be rolling and falling off the narrow pathways regularly. Clicking for every single shot with the basic pistol is tedious. The developer told me they would consider changing this several months ago, but it still persists today. Finally, the performance has always been, and still is, quite bad. Even with Vsync on, this makes my gaming rig scream. I really don't see why, but it does.Pros:+ The artwork, universe, and overall aesthetic is coolCons:- To a casual observer, the development is really slow- The price-point is too high for something that has essentially been done a million times before- Optimization continues to be poor; will it ever be improved? Who knows- Using a controller hinders you- Combat is uninspired- Awkward camera angle and narrow pathways are not fun for me- I'm just not compelled to play thisI bought into this based on the slick artwork, but from my experience over the past year - this gets a hard pass from me.

I originally passed on this title after playing the demo, but later bought in after watching a streamer. It boils down to the demo not conveying the whole sandbox aspect.The Coin Game is really neat. The best comparison is to My Summer Car, as said by The Carlz0r. What this means is that while we have a main gameplay focus on earning tickets from arcade games (with individual Leaderboards!), but there is also this whole sandbox going on. You have a fairly large island to explore and do odd and zany things. I delivered papers, got addicted to scratch-off tickets, and found a UFO. Things like that.What I do need to convey is that there isn't all that much content right now. The arcade games are good fun, but there are only a handful at this point. The island is large, but we only have one job of a paper route so far. There is a lot of potential, and I can easily recommend it in the current state for the small asking price, but you should know what you are getting into. I explored just about everything and got the Achievements I wanted all in under 2 hours. But I did have fun. I really hope this gets constantly expanded, because the sky is the limit with this one. It would be awesome to have a large community with Steam Workshop support.Pros:+I love this new niche genre of open sandbox with strange goals+This is quite fun+While there are only a few things to do, they are done right+Individual Leaderboards for each arcade game go a long way hereCons:-Hopefully this project doesn't get dropped, and a ton of content is added over time-There are plenty of rough edges (cars have no AI and just plow through you, arcades glitch out; things like this)Yeah, this is a fun one.

Like most titles in this niche space (ie. Akane or Tormentor X Punisher), the experience is small, yet potent. The price-point pretty much says it all. If you are compelled to really put your skills to the test, you'll likely get a lot of mileage out of games like this. At this point, I'll buy anything Sean Young is involved in because the projects are always outside-the-box thinking with a more-than-fair asking price. This is no exception.Essentially, this is a single screen bullet hell dodge-em-up with one central boss. You need to collect three 'orbs' and then you can use your body to hurt the boss. Three hits moves you on to the next phase. You die in one hit. The store page boasts 'procgen AI/boss battles', but unless I'm missing something, that is a bit misleading. I haven't found anything 'procgen'. I have found that there is a pool of boss attacks, and what order you get them in seems to be random. Other than that everything is pretty much the same, and that's fine. At first the movement system is super awkward, but after about 30 minutes I was getting much more dexterous with it. The whole thing is fun in a one-more-run kind of way.Pros:+Fresh take on the twitch-style arena games  +The price-point is more than fair+The artwork and music is niceMeh:=The lore fragments are neat, but the story really doesn't feel like it fits the settingCons:-No pause button, and I can't justify that here-I think the term 'procgen' is misleading on the store page-Your mileage really will vary depending on how compelled you are to play this style of game-This is a neat idea that really could have been expanded into a more fuller experienceWraithslayer is a neat and original indie game experience.

This is very much a glorified spreadsheet with no story, game, or goals. I know that is stated on the store page, and sometimes that kind of system works - but unfortunately not here. And on top of that, the incredibly rough edges are insult to injury.Essentially, you are given a short list of 'warriors' that have a few stats attached to them, and you pit them against each other. The outcome is honestly boring and quite predictable. Each row of the spreadsheet is one warrior. The list of possible input commands is horribly jumbled most of the time due to the limitations of the terminal window in which you are working/playing (and not jumbled in any consistent way, either). Mixing that jumble with some of the artsy use of ASCII and it just comes off broken. You can choose two warriors at random to fight, choose two directly to fight, or make time pass which alters some stats. As-is, the Achievements are quite easy to cheese and most end up being an exercise in spamming keys. It's kind of a shame, because with just a tad more complexity combined with some clever Achievement goals, we may actually have something to work with here. Pros:+ I like the crunchy indie styleCons:- Simply not enough content- No compelling reason to play other than figuring it out - which takes about 5-10 minutes- Achievements could have been a bit more clever- Rough edges galoreI'm glad games like this exist, but this title could have benefited from baking a bit longer.

W4RR-i/o-RS: Descent is a small scope turn-based puzzle game. There is nothing 'RPG' about it, so take the store page description with a grain of salt.

I'm not going to explain how it works because that is the fun of it; that's what you are paying for here. All I can say is that I found it quite interesting to first figure out how the system works, and then use that knowledge to complete the game.

The artwork is fantastic, but nearly everything else needs a good bit of work. For starters, the movement feels like you are on ice. Yes, I've heard this is going to be worked on - but getting movement to feel right and work right isn't a simple thing. We'll see. Next, there is no controller support right now, and I find WASD plus the number keys to be a chore. You have to push the number keys quickly in the heat of battle, which leaves me wrestling more with controls than monsters. The combat system is overly simple, and is mostly an exercise in spam clicking. Most of my time was spent kiting and circling around enemies. This is a product of small one screen arenas.Again, the artwork and animations are remarkable. I do hope more assets are planned to be added, though. The first three levels were exactly the same, and there really wasn't much variation within them, either. The procgen is very much a tile toss. I fought two minibosses which were the exact same troll. This is the kind of stuff that really needs some TLC and refinement. Will it get there? We'll see.Pros:+Beautiful artwork+The price-point is obviously not an issue; in fact it's too cheapCons:-Movement is bad-Strategy really boils down to circling and kiting enemies-Each screen is an arena that really feels too small, and this is also related to my strategy note above-Managing WASD and the number keys is a chore-While the assets are remarkable in quality, we need more-The procgen level layouts are ho-humI get that my expectations shouldn't be high for a four dollar game. I do get that, and maybe the creator just wants to make a simple proof-of-concept roguelite. If that is the case, then I guess I can't argue. But if the goal is to create something addicting and fun and fresh - then hopefully some of my points above can be useful. I wish the developer the best for a successful Early Access campaign.

What we have here is a permanent upgrade system like in titles such as Rogue Legacy or Immortal Redneck, mixed with some vanilla aRPG dungeon crawling. And it's all just a bit too slow for my tastes. It felt like the runs were watered down by being far too easy until you hit a wall. I would prefer a more potent experience where I die sooner and earn more gold in the meantime. Tighter loops; shorter runs. Now I'm sure this is a labor-of-love project with modest ambition - and I appreciate and applaud that. I just don't find it compelling and therefore can't recommend my friends run out and put down their money.While we've been over this before - I have to again reiterate that this particular type of permanent upgrade system is tricky in that it doesn't so much reward skill, as it does grind. You grind to get permanent upgrades and buffs, in turn to grind to get further in the dungeon. It can work, but in general this is my least favorite way to manage upgrades. The upgrades are all standard, too. We have stereotypical upgrades like damage buffs, and classic playable classes. This is an easy and free opportunity to make this title stand out from the sea of dungeon crawlers out there.There are rough edges. Sure, it's an Early Access campaign. I get that. Controller support is pretty wonky right now. Many of the enemy sprites are muddy and really hard to tell what they are. The enemy AI is quite bad (they get stuck on corners and walls). Building your fortress sounds great, but it really just boils down to a tech/skill tree. Level design is nothing special. Again, I'm not trying to hate on a pet project, but all these things add up to something I can live without. Pros:+I can't argue with the price+I do like the idea of a bite-size aRPG rogue-ish gameCons:-There is nothing fresh here-Overly standard dungeon crawler-The enemy artwork is muddy-Controller support needs a good bit of work-The dungeon crawling is a bit too slow, and runs too long for my tastesIt isn't about the money with this one, it's about your time. I do wish the developer the best with this and any future projects - but this gets a hard pass from me.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/946610,"12 February, 2019",1.0,1.0

Bigger map, a vehicle to help navigate this expanded terrain, and tank fights (and Riddler collectibles) to give it an air of necessity. Anything from the previous games were either kept the same or directly upgraded. Combat is mainly untouched (including Batman's patented Disarm and Destroy), with slightly new enemy variations to be aware of (such as shield brutes). Gadgets and stealth mechanics have been refined, the most obvious examples of each being the Disruptor and Fear Takedowns, the latter of which I've only seen re-used in one other game I've played (Ghost of Tsushima). Gadget cooldowns in general are much saner compared to Arkham City, especially Smoke Pellets being usable more than once per stealth encounter now, so there's no need to be so stingy with those any more.Aside from the odd lategame bug (like glitching after a death in a stealth boss fight and walking, not gliding, off a vantage point while aiming the REC gun), my only complaints were with the storytelling. The Season of Infamy DLC was a wonderful way to wrap up the stories of characters from previous games that fans may have been curious about (especially Mr Freeze), but most of the base game's side missions were map-clearing busywork (some of which I did still very much enjoy) or pointless hunts/chases (both fire missions, hunting Man-Bat, bomb defusals, checkpoints, and watchtowers), which were successful in making Riddler's collectibles seem that much more appealing. You also had one-time missions (involving Jack Ryder or Lucius Fox) that seemed to only exist as filler despite having both been built up as something big, and I do wonder if these missions were shortened as a result of rushed development. I thought the Two-Face, Penguin, serial killer, and Riddler missions were great though, both narratively and in gameplay. The only reason the main story has any more weight than Rocksteady's previous games is due to how heavy-handed they wanted to be about Batman: Arkham Knight being the series' swan song, and unlike with Arkham City, the game's story, gameplay, and general pacing isn't at odds with its theming too, so I stayed immersed easily.Batman's sidekicks seem to have generally been aged down to all be closer in age, with the exception of Robin being aged up. Changing Barbara's voice actress to somebody younger than in the previous games and then making her seem a naive damsel in distress (although admittedly Batman's entire entourage gets kidnapped throughout this game) shouldn't sit very well for any Batman fans. I still wish I could've seen more interactions between the Bat-Family overall. It was fun playing as Nightwing, Catwoman, and Robin in their respective moments tag-teaming with Batman, with their movesets and arsenals from Arkham City being mostly unmodified as well for any players retaining the muscle memory.Altogether I'd say it's an 8/10 game, and I don't recall the last time I spent the best part of a month playing a game so obsessively, nor am I going to stop any time soon.

Very good worldbuilding, even if the plot leaves something to be desired.The first game had a variation of 9 combat moves, and this one ups that count to 13, at the cost of heavily nerfing the Batclaw. You get new abilities such as Freeflow Focus, which lets you move faster while enemies move slower (but you can still take damage and lose your Freeflow in this state). For traversal, you get a new Grapnel Boost which lets you glide around without ever having to touch down as long as you have something to boost off of, and there are a few glide-powered takedowns which make street brawls that much more fun to start. There are new enemies, such as armored and shielded enemies, but you still have knife-wielding enemies (taken down a little differently this time), and Titan thugs, who are mainly saved for Riddler's Revenge.Riddler's Revenge is the main blemish on this otherwise-fun game. It's ridiculous that they managed to make collectible-hunting so fun, but then rewarded our efforts with THIS. For completion, the first game only made you complete 4 maps on 2 difficulties for both combat and stealth (totalling 24 medals in each). In Arkham City, you have 24 maps (12 with normal difficulties and score tiering, 12 on extreme), and that's not all. You also have to complete ""campaigns"", gauntlets of 3 challenge maps in a row where the aim is to earn all 9 medals (earning all possible medals from all maps) in one go. Also unlike the first game, the score tiering is much harsher this time around. For most combat maps in Asylum, the old formula was Silver and Gold tiers being double and triple the Bronze score respectively, but now in Arkham City they're double and quadruple (respectively), making each map much more of a grind. The whole thing seems sadistically designed to punish players, rather than supplement the experience like Asylum's challenges did.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/200260,1 May,90.9,19.4

I know players claim there's a rhythm to it and that you shouldn't button-mash, but my experience has been the complete opposite.You only have a window of like 1-2 seconds at most to add each successive move to your combo before it expires.Countering only works if you're within the enemy's attack area (so you could be millimetres out of it and break your combo in your attempt to counter because the game decides this time that it won't clip you into countering their move and you're left grappling with thin air)You're told far too late in the tutorial stage that you have to work up to a x3 combo (with regular hits) to enter freeflow to begin with, after numerous skirmishes with Blackgate thugs.The other type of enemy engagement, the stealth, almost feels like an afterthought. There is only one ability upgrade that pertains directly to your stealth moveset, and while more of your gadgets are oriented at stealth sections rather than the open combat/freeflow sections (in which you're only allowed to effectively utilise the batclaw and batarang without breaking combos), the core game (at least in story mode) doesn't have enough of it to make you feel like you get to use them well enough. The predator challenges do somewhat recognise it since their medals demand that you make use of the otherwise-underutilised bat-gadgets.Most boss fights are basically the same, fight a brute hopped up on Titan while his comrades attempt to wear you down. Only 2-3 boss fights are any different here.Being only able to heal by gathering XP, whether from collectibles or beating fights, made progression annoying for most of my first couple of runs at this game. It gets better if you get the hang of freeflow and/or just reload when you take major damage though.And now the positives.Scarecrow and Ivy's boss fights/levels were genuinely FUN boss fights, Riddler's collectibles felt padded but not to the level of, say, a Ubisoft sandbox, and more importantly they were all easy enough to complete without having to use the internet as long as you find his maps, despite whatever he incorrectly claims. Combat is satisfying once you get the hang of it (I recommend practising your available moves in challenge modes if you're not getting frequent high combos in story mode). Mark Hamill absolutely nails his Joker persona as always, but Kevin Conroy's performance wasn't as dramatic as he could've been in the climax, far too quiet.The game radiates machismo, which is very much take-it-or-leave-it as Rocksteady's ideal Batman clearly seems to be one that prefers to primarily solve things with his fists. The game has standard backtracking to older areas with newer gadgets, just as with any Metroidvania. I personally enjoyed this part but I understand that most people typically don't care so much.Bottom line, it's a superhero game with quality beyond games as buggy as are released nowadays, so I'd recommend it to anyone. Has a good amount of replayability in the challenges, which I'm probably gonna try for next.								",https://steamcommunity.com/app/35140,7 March,14.1,10.0
