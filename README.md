# steam-reviews
We have two branches, the main branch has all the code I use.
This includes:
1) Steam_reviews:This file allows us to get all the historical reviews of a single steam user through the steam api. This document is divided into two steps.
Step 1: get a lot of steam ids through steam api and chain propagation. 
Step 2: Through these ids, visit their review page and get data such as reviews content.
2) steam_review_scraped: Using the data scraped by the first ipybn document to scrape the text data
3) PS928: This is the analysis code
