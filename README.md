# steam-reviews
This file allows us to get all the historical reviews of a single steam user through the steam api. This document is divided into two steps.
Step 1: get a lot of steam ids through steam api and chain propagation. 
Step 2: Through these ids, visit their review page and get data such as reviews content.
